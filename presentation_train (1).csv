3rd Party - Making Smart Platforms Stick (Aug-20).pdf,"In this report from McKinsey, feedback from numerous companies across different industries highlighted once again that platform modularity is high on strategic agendas as it helps combat the uncontrolled growth in solution complexity. Even after successful pilots, a company's implementation of a platform strategy can be faced with slippage due to improper org structures, a lack of immediate benefit, and the maturity in platform thinking being unbalanced across the company. To ensure sustainable and lasting impact of smart platforms strategies, McKinsey details five key principles around org structure, processes, systems, performance management and culture.","in this article, we explained the concept of a smart platform strategy and modularization. the feedback from numerous project-based companies across different industries highlighted once again that modularity is a topic that remains high on their strategic agendas. modularity helps combat the uncontrolled growth in solution2 complexity in several ways: costs are reduced by minimizing operational complexity, competitiveness is increased by accelerating project delivery, and customers benefit from more competitive pricing. higher-quality solution and more flexibility are also clear benefits of modular approach. the smart platform strategy resonates well with many companies and proves to be applicable in various contexts. for companies that are at the beginning of their platform journey, it provides a basis for how to organize and communicate their journey within their organizations. for companies that have already embarked on their platform journeys, the strategy helps put their identified challenges into perspective and derive concrete actions going forward regardless of where a company is on its journey, one challenge is common: making smart platforms stick! even if companies have successfully created and begun implementing a competitive, modular portfolio and achieved success with their modular solutions in real projects, many see themselves faced with challenges regarding their long-term ability to hold on to this strategy. given this concern, the focus of this article is on what is required of a company to firmly anchor a smart platform strategy deep within its organization going beyond just the design of modular solutions and making a smart platforms part of its DNA. we tried to harmonize our portfolio once already but fell back into old habits. i think we underestimated how much would be needed to change how people operate.smart platform strategy compared to typical situation in project industries from fully customized solutions to customized, yet modularized smart platforms starting point is the copy of an old reference machine high number of options without clear customer benefit missing defined interfaces lead to high engineering effort firefighting to solve issues on customer sites high uncertainty in project scope at contract signing new offers are configured using ready-to-use building blocks projects tailored to customer needs with higher margins engineering focuses on innovation, rather than reinventing existing solutions efficient and stable processes based on proven modules basic design 100% clear at contract signing making smart platforms stick: how to sustainably anchor a smart platform strategy in an organization smart platform strategies often start successfully, but three types of challenges often lead to slippage even after conducting successful pilots for developing and implementing modular solutions, some organizations struggle to translate that approach into a new standard way of working. three archetypes of challenges seem to undermine many companies attempts to take smart platforms from a project level to a fundamental and enduring business strategy. Organizational structure is not implemented properly after an initial focus on the more technical aspect of modularizing the portfolio, organizational requirements for a successful end-to-end management of that portfolio are sometimes neglected. companies often fail to acknowledge the long-term investment needed to make change stick: clear ownership structures, adjusted roles and responsibilities, and simplified decision processes fail to get implemented. once the program management support is ramped down, the organization falls back into old ways of working. the benefit is not immediately visible as mentioned, the key objective of modularization is to reduce complexity costs or increase customer value by creating a more competitive product portfolio. however, no one wants to invest in a year-long (or even years-long) implementation of a platform strategy only to find out in the end that there are no tangible benefits. without early, clear, and measurable corporate objectives with ambitions that grow over time, the impact of the smart platform strategy does 2019 become evident for quite some time, and the strategy loses momentum.3 maturity of smart platform thinking is unbalanced across the organization as a smart platform strategy is inherently cross-functional, certain challenges arise around the pace of different functions in the organization. in particular, different levels of maturity in understanding and implementing the smart platform strategy between r&d and sales can lead to misalignment and misunderstanding between two key functions in bringing the smart platform strategy to life.5 making smart platforms stick: how to sustainably anchor a smart platform strategy in an organization five principles can help anchor smart platform strategies five principles address the challenges described on the previous page and help companies embed smart platforms in their dna, giving them a better chance at sustainability

anchor a smart platform strategy in an organization.organizational structures support the implementation and long-term success of smart platforms whether a platform remains smart and modular or creeps back into unwieldy complexity depends on decisions regarding if and when elements are added or customized. if a smart platform strategy is going to stick, it will be, in part, because the organizational structure the roles, responsibilities, and authorities in which these decisions are made supports the strategy. at companies without a modular portfolio, the organizational structure is often focused on single projects and customized solutions. prioritizing modularity often means a shift toward a more module-based approach which, in turn, commonly requires new roles and responsibilities. whereas multiple project managers once had oversight of their distinct and largely independent projects, module leads take responsibility for standardized modules that span across projects. moreover, a function focused on systems architecture and integration, called the platform lead, now works to ensure the compatibility of platform and module standards across projects. to be successful, the mandate for this cross-functional ownership of the platform must be clear and is often sponsored from the highest levels of the organization. specifically, we identified three roles to support the longevity of the modular strategy:module leads global module development and driving module innovation is owned by module leads who also manage module complexity and full lifecycle costs. they decide on the introduction or phase out of module variants and ensure that economies of scale and best practices are applied and transferred between platforms.platform leads the platform development and strategy is defined by the platform leads who carefully manage the complexity of the platform and the underlying interfaces. they also drive platform innovation and make sure that the platform fulfills all requirements.product portfolio managers the global and regional product portfolio is defined by the product portfolio managers based on market insights and required features. they also ensure there is sufficient differentiation across products within the portfolio. take, for example, a company that produces forklifts. module leads will be responsible for different modules, e.g., one for the hydraulic system, one for the chassis, and another one for the battery. all of those modules are used in different platforms each headed by a platform lead, e.g., one platform for small indoor forklifts, one for larger outdoor forklifts. the platform lead 9 making smart platforms stick: how to sustainably anchor a smart platform strategy in an organization similar requirements. the balanced structure enables close alignment of the portfolio and the platform strategy. a central function thereby helps resolve conflicts between r&d and sales.these three roles do not replace the classic customer project manager, but they influence that position's roles and responsibilities. for example, within this new organizational structure, project managers would now be required to use the existing basic parts of the smart platform and must obtain approval if they want to deviate from the platform. the project manager now focuses more on the classic project management tasks and less on new development. therefore, on top of introducing new roles, the roles and responsibilities of existing roles must be redefined. besides the specific roles needed to anchor a smart platform strategy, a broader adjacent question remains on how to structure the operating model of the r&d organization. several established companies have started the journey toward an agile operating model. the agile transformation acts as an enabler for the smart platform strategy: breaking down customer values and business goals into prioritized feature sets that are developed by agile teams is a good foundation for incorporating smart platform development. the details of an agile operating model are not the focus of this article; however, they should be considered along the smart platform journey. the benefit of this model is the forklift portfolio manager is that r&d has control over technical responsible for the specific offering of specifications and can sustain the different forklifts in different markets, modular system through internal e.g., the special sub-zero temperature incentives. the tradeoffs are that variant for use in cold regions.r&d tends not to have a complete the

strong technology a new variant for a certain market, the focus may also lack sufficient platform lead will evaluate what that understanding of the customer means for the portfolio and if a new variant of a certain module is needed, market-focused model it will be discussed with the module for companies operating in fast-lead, who will then take care of the moving markets and with limited new development. economies of scale across regions, when defining these roles, companies a market-focused model may best are typically faced with multiple support the sustainability of a smart

between the technology- and places the end-to-end product market-driven models is a structure that responsibility with r&d represented can work for companies with different by the module and platform

scenarios for operating model.formal processes and mechanisms ensure that the smart platform strategy becomes completely embedded in daily work the easier it is to depart from established smart platform processes, the more likely an organization will slide back into the inefficiency of excessive complexity. in addition to many others, there are two areas in particular where formal processes and mechanisms must be adhered to in order to lock in the smart platform strategy: sales and portfolio management. 13 making smart platforms stick: how to sustainably anchor a smart platform strategy in an organization sales in sales, the process goal is to sell a harmonized portfolio from the lead stage all the way to closing. if projects are not defined and sold in a modular way from the beginning, a smart platform strategy is moot. in order to avoid that, facilitating platform compliance as well as adequately training the workforce are important. facilitating platform compliance the sales process should include mechanisms that guard against moving away from the platform principles. in the early sales phase, transparent measures should be put in place to review platform applicability, to ensure that a modular solution is explored from the beginning and sales activities are focused on platform-compliant projects rather than on those that are likely to deviate from the platform. a steel plant engineering company, e.g., determined whether to participate in a project bid based on a newly introduced milestone meeting at the very beginning of the sales process, which assessed the fit between the request and their smart platform strategy. in later sales phases, such an applicability measure could be replaced by platform-compliance measures. in general, any deviation from the platform should be signed off by a platform compliance board (consisting of relevant senior management representatives) to centrally safeguard the platform principles. each project needs a clear justification for any deviation it seeks. any approvals of deviation should loop back to the module and platform leads to take a conscious decision on a potential update of the smart platform. an aerospace company, e.g., had their module leads attend all key milestone meetings for each project to make sure projects did not deviate from the smart platform strategy, but also to ensure the module leads became aware of the discussions and needs around their modules.training the workforce the shift from engineer-to-order to configure-to-order is a radical change that requires regular training to promote best practices and ensure homogeneous approaches across sales regions and teams. the focus of this training should be on the latest platform-compliant products/modules in the catalog, understanding the advantages for both the customer and the company, and available supporting tooling. having the training sessions led by the sales management team highlights the importance of the platform and strengthens the impact of the training.exhibit different platform mechanisms help anchor the smart different platform mechanisms help anchor the smart platform approach

flexible about customer requests, even if they are very particular, is one of our core strengths. so, we introduced a non-standard request process to introduce highly customized solutions but make sure that they do not negatively influence the rest of our modular system.201d r&d manager portfolio management development of new modules or variants should be done by a cross-the processes related to portfolio functional development team. management span across three areas: the perspectives of all relevant adding variants, removing variants, and stakeholders (e.g., sales, r&d, supply maintaining variants.chain, operations) throughout the adding module variants lifecycle of a module should be taken variants can be added to the portfolio into account when developing new by either external prompting (i.e., modules. finally, the role or team that customer requests) or internal requested the new variants should prompting (i.e., technology innovation). approve the new variant after finalizing in the case of the former, it is important the development phase to make sure to have a healthy separation between that the variant fulfills all expected those who might benefit from additional requirements.variants (e.g., sales) and those who maintaining module variants have the authority to add a variant. establishing an effective module to avoid conflicts of interest and maintenance process is necessary give modularity its best chance, a to keep the smart platform strategy relatively independent board should up to date and aligned with customer be entrusted with variant approvals. requirements as well as market this board will seek the input of multiple standards and legal specifications. stakeholders including module leads, for some companies where the rate platform leads, marketing, sales, etc. is, by definition of the business model, and calculate the cost of complexity. very low, it might not be feasible to if the push for adding variants comes keep the detailed documentation from the customer, proper evaluation of and calculations of the entire variant the benefits of the new variant through portfolio up to date. in such cases, the a nonstandard request process is supporting documents are continuously necessary. to avoid proliferation, some updated for reference variants only companies use the rule that for each and used as the starting point for added variant, an existing variant has new projects. to be removed. another very effective instrument in the module maintenance process is a (semi)annual portfolio conference, where all modules of the platform are reviewed. the review can be supported by a  take rate  analysis, which evaluates how often a variant is selected by the customers. customer needs and the technology innovation roadmap can be aligned with the module development roadmap, and the addition of new module variants to the portfolio can be proposed during this conference. modules with a low take rate or negative business case can be identified and ultimately removed from the portfolio.removing module variants to ensure variants that overlap with each other or are not in demand by customers are removed from the portfolio, a regular review needs to be formalized, e.g., as preparation for the biyearly portfolio conference. if the decision is made to remove a particular variant, it is also important to ensure that the decision is communicated to relevant stakeholders e.g., informing the sales team that the variant has been removed from the catalog or configurator and that adequate support for an end-of-life process of that variant is secured.15 making smart platforms stick: how to sustainably anchor a smart platform strategy in an organization it proved to be critical to ensure that variants we had decided to remove from our catalog were actually blocked in all systems. in the beginning, we kept them as a reference for our spare parts business, but they were still being used every now and then even though they were flagged as retired.2019 it only stopped once we made it technically impossible to include those variants in sales offers.201d technical director cross-functional alignment in the definition phase of new variants helped us create buy-in for the modular platform the platform was jointly defined as one team and not only by one or two functions.automated systems integrate smart platforms into all relevant workflows automated systems help weave modularity into the very fabric of the organization. with the help of it tools, the commitment to smart platforms not only becomes an integral part of how business is conducted but veering off the path becomes more difficult. tools can either be adjusted to incorporate the smart platform strategy or be newly introduced/developed to accelerate the adoption of smart platform thinking. the following it-enabled tools are examples that have become reliable ways of making smart platform strategy stick at many companies. solutions configurators solutions configurators, at the heart of smart platforms, can be implemented to help strictly link customer requirements to available module configurations via predefined rules (exhibit 5). the tool therefore represents the single source of truth, a jointly maintained system that includes all the rules and covers all the modules of the smart platform. as such, this tool is a powerful enabler for positioning the platform and its underlying modules prominently within the sales and solution design phases and should be introduced as soon as possible. to quickly implement such a configurator, many companies work with minimum viable products. for example, an excel file containing all variants and rules was used at a plant manufacturing company, while a manufacturer of construction vehicles had a simple web app programmed. this helps to establish a rule- and fact-based modular way of thinking in the organization early on, gather findings for the development of the final configurator, and verify the market applicability of available variants. the configurator could subsequently be neatly tied to the modular pricing rules, automated sales documents, existing erp systems, and the r&d roadmap there are multiple ready-to-use it solutions on the market. the link to the r&d roadmap is especially important in order to obtain required information about the development status and potential updates of each variant.modular pricing tools are convincing enablers for both sales and customers for whom price is a key factor in their discussions. by transparently making the link between complexity and price through connecting the solutions configurator to the pricing tools, modular pricing tools set the right incentives and highlight the benefit of adhering to the smart platform boundaries. specifically, platform-compliant solutions should have cost or lead-time advantages, whereas more specialized or highly customized solutions should be penalized through the inclusion of additional costs of complexity. for example, an oil and gas company that was struggling from a significant proliferation of the portfolio driven by very customized requests from sales decided to clearly split their product portfolio in catalog and custom products, ensuring requests from catalog had significantly lower costs and much shorter delivery times. making the difference visible helped to significantly increase the share of products sold from the catalog without any customizations.additionally, a stable module portfolio helps an organization to introduce value-based pricing and maximize profit margins based on the actual value of certain modules. with the help of cpq systems (configure, price, quote), the modular pricing logic could be combined with the aforementioned solutions configurator.r&d roadmap tooling r&d roadmap tooling should reflect the development of modules based on the same rule-based logic as the solutions configurator. ensuring a smart platform way of thinking in the r&d roadmap avoids the development of specific configurations that fail to take into account future variations and supports effective prioritization by balancing complexity costs with market coverage. linking the r&d roadmap automatically with the solutions configurator provides transparency on the status of platform.automated sales documents automated sales documents can help keep companies on the modular path by shortening lead times for the creation of offers as well as reducing errors, which might lead to renegotiations with customers. these documents would include, among others, detailed technical specifications or 3d visualization. the automation of such documents has the potential to not only speed up the sales process, but its reduced effort will also incentivize sales teams to stick to the smart platform solution. other it systems that should be adjusted to reflect the smart platform strategy include the parts catalog, the material master data, and the finance systems, to allow costs to be allocated not only to projects but also to modules."
3rd Party - The Future of Retail in APAC (Aug-20).pdf,"Given the advanced digital maturity in the region, Bain highlights that retail in APAC is generating three-quarters of global growth and two-thirds of online growth. Despite the diversity across the region, the study suggests that countries fall into four groups: mature followers, digital leaders, fast modernizers, and developing digitalizers. Among these categories, fast modernizers  such as India, Vietnam, and Indonesia  are poised for a strong evolution like Chinas and are expected to remain in the forefront of online sales. Growth opportunities will depend on retailers ability to customize their last-mile approach based on local needs, a key factor for HERE to consider when addressing last mile solutions in APAC.","imagine a retail world in which cash is dead and phone screens are the new storefronts. physical stores still exist, but mostly as showrooms for more involved purchases or as stock lists of items for immediate consumption. artificial intelligence sets product prices and technologists outnumber merchants at head office. around the world, covid-19 has accelerated retail's transition to a digital future that might well look like this. but it's clear which region will get there first: asia-pacific. in china and other parts of the region, retail is leapfrogging development stages that the us and europe once toiled through. instead of expanding physical store space to western levels of saturation, executives are seeking urgent answers to cutting-edge e-commerce questions. how should we work with super-apps  such as wechat, paytm and gojek? should we team up with an ecosystem such as alibaba, tencent or flipkart? how can we solve the last-mile delivery challenge, given that competitors are delivering within 30 minutes of an order? what new store formats would optimize our omnichannel reach?this advanced digital maturity is one reason why asia-pacific should remain the industry's growth engine, as well as its window to the future. currently, the region is generating about three-quarters of global retail growth and about two-thirds of online growth. from 2014 to 2019, the compound annual growth rate for asia-pacific retail sales was more than quadruple that of the rest of the world. online sales growth was nearly double the rest of the world's, even though asia-pacific e-commerce was starting from a higher base (online penetration in the region grew from 9% to 19% between 2014 and 2019, while rising from 6% to 11% in the rest of the world.)in a region of 48 countries that includes the mature markets of australia and japan, there's no single path to a thriving future. yet we do see similarities in how the nimblest executive teams are seizing opportunities. crucially, they are prioritizing action in six areas: reinventing their value proposition, winning digital engagement, future proofing assets and operations, mastering the last mile and supply chain resilience, defining their ecosystem destination and retooling for digital. retailers that master these imperatives should gain a sustainable edge over rivals.the future of retail in asia-pacific: how to thrive at high speed making sense of asia-pacific's retail diversity across asia-pacific retail, there's massive variation. in india, for example, traditional family-run stores (kiranas) and stalls still make up the majority of retail sales, but in japan small family operations like these were mostly overtaken by chains and big-box formats long ago.to tease out the hidden patterns across this diverse landscape, we first gauged the maturity of key markets in the region by assessing retailer concentration ratios, the build-out of physical selling space per capita and other measures of local development. then we mapped that maturity assessment against the current ferocity of that country's digital disruption, using metrics such as online retail penetration and the e-commerce market share of top digital players. segmented in this way, asia-pacific countries cluster into four categories, each with its own trajectory. india, vietnam and indonesia are fast modernizers. their disruption and maturity levels may be low today, but they are primed for disproportionate digital acceleration. just look at india: its second-biggest retailer by sales is not a brick-and-mortar chain but flipkart, a digital native founded in 2007 and now majority-owned by walmart. fast modernizers are likely to come to resemble china today. currently, china stands on its own as a digital leader exhibiting high disruption and low market maturity china is poised to remain in the e-commerce vanguard, aided by domestic digital giants such as alibaba, jd.com and pinduoduo.  japan and australia are asia-pacific's mature followers. in these countries both disruption and maturity are high, and future evolution is likely to be more measured in many cases. south korea stands out as the leader within this category. its digital prowess, exemplified by omnichannel leaders such as lotte and shinsegae, points the way to what is possible for other mature followers in asia-pacific and beyond, including the us, the uk and france. the final cluster of countries consists of developing digitalizers: malaysia, the philippines and thailand, whose low digital disruption and medium maturity is reminiscent of russia, mexico and brazil. they are heading for mature follower status.six imperatives to thrive in asia-pacific's retail future in all four asian-pacific market clusters, there are outstanding retailers whose executive teams have proved themselves adept at anticipating and adapting to rapid change. covid-19 has only accelerated many of the trends that were already on the radar screens of these companies.the pandemic has most obviously hastened the migration of sales from brick-and-mortar stores to online channels. the pandemic has most obviously hastened the migration of sales from brick-and-mortar stores to online channels. it has also increased demand for fast and reliable delivery most vividly seen in the surging adoption of online grocery.covid-19 has given fresh impetus to other shifts, widening the economic gap between haves and have- nots and further fragmenting the path to purchase by impelling consumers to shop (and live) through mobile phones. that's on top of the operational repercussions of the virus, such as the paramount need to safeguard employees and customers, and other, non-covid-related trends. the most effective responses to these myriad challenges are going to look very different than the strategies that worked in the past. in particular, we think executive teams can succeed by focusing on six imperatives.1. reinvent your value proposition even after the transformative growth of the last few decades, asia-pacific consumers are still becoming more middle class and urban and more digitally driven, too, aided by the fact that those born after the 1990s are heavily represented in regional demographics. with the exception of china and india, dual-income households are on the rise as women continue to join the workforce. yet the gap between richest and poorest has also widened in many parts of the region, and covid-19 is ratcheting up pressure on the most deprived by increasing unemployment. 3 the future of retail in asia-pacific: how to thrive at high speed retailers must ensure their value proposition meets the needs of this fast-evolving customer base. that might involve putting ultra-convenience at the heart of their offering in response to denser urbanization and the rise of time-poor dual-income households; ready meals are already growing in popularity, for instance their penetration rate more than doubled in south korea and thailand between 2010 and 2019. as more consumers struggle financially in covid-19's economically destructive wake, some retailers might benefit from pushing deeper into value/discount formats and offers. as more consumers struggle financially in covid-19's economically destructive wake, some retailers might benefit from pushing deeper into value/discount formats and offers.others might tilt toward rising interest in health, wellness and sustainability or use advanced analytics to meet swelling demand for personalization. 2. win digital engagement whatever a retailer's evolving value proposition, improved digital engagement with shoppers is likely to be vital particularly through mobile phones. asia-pacific consumers already tend to do most of their online shopping through their phones, and this trend is set to deepen, with forester forecasting that 70% to 85% of e-commerce will be conducted by phone in 2023 in key regional markets . amid this mobile migration, the path to purchase is still fragmenting. people are buying more through super-apps such as wechat, paytm, kakaotalk and grab. e-commerce through social media has also been gaining ground in recent years, as shown by chinese influencer li jiaqi success at selling lipstick on taobao live streams or the video app doujin. consumers have increasingly turned to social commerce like this during the pandemic. when bain & company surveyed 4,700 consumers in china this spring, they told us that they were now more likely to use livestreams and short-form videos as a research and purchasing tool than they had been before covid-19 .asia-pacific retailers have to follow the eyeballs of their customers. they need to optimize their presence on super-apps and social commerce channels (perhaps even nurturing their own li jiaqis). they should keep asking themselves if they are serving up the right content formats for current preferences regardless of the channel, retailers need to keep improving the user experience online. for many, there is still much work to do. when bain surveyed 1,100 consumers in australia in may 2020, we found their willingness to recommend a retailer, measured as a net promoter score, tended to be 4the future of retail in asia-pacific.post pandemic,all stages of the path to purchase are set to digitize further we asked chinese consumers which digital channels they used in 2019 during four separate shopping stages and which they were likely to use in the coming year.live streaming, short video and social community can be redirected to e-commerce platforms for purchase; some live streaming/short video has embedded purchase feature/platform source: bain china consumer survey expected growth in use in the next 12 months vs. 2019 percentage of consumers used in 2019 lower for online purchases than in-store shopping. for the most alienated online shoppers, website problems were a serious issue, comprising more than one quarter of the reasons given for their dissatisfaction.future proof assets and operations in asia-pacific, only retailers in australia and japan (and to a lesser extent south korea) have built out their physical store networks as extensively as their counterparts in the us and western europe. outside these territories, the region's retailers are finding growth enough online and are now unlikely to expand their physical network to anything like western levels of ubiquity (see figure 3). old formats will need to be updated or even abandoned. the online migration of sales, hastened by covid-19, is squeezing supermarkets and hypermarkets. for example, sales per square meter in hypermarkets declined by 6% in south korea and 14% in china between 2014 and 2019; rising costs make that declining sales density unsustainable. conversely, convenience stores have already been gaining traction. in china and south korea, they were the fastest-growing format between 2014 and 2019, posting double-digit growth. that growth reflects how shopping has become more local across the region, a trend that has now been given extra momentum by covid-19. stores will need to change role as well as format, contributing to a more seamless omnichannel whole as the sales mix tilts further to e-commerce. more stores will operate as showrooms or hubs for order  .online shopping has exploded in markets with less mature store networks selling space per capita and physical expansion won't catch upselling space per capita. euro monitors out korea china india southeast asia change of e-commerce penetration picking or click-and-collect services, with increasing level of automation (as is already the case at cutting- edge stores operated by emart in south korea and hema in china.) given rising labor costs (up by half in china since 2014) and expensive real estate in many asia-pacific cities, it is more important than ever that retailers scour their cost base for savings. moving to zero- base costs can help, while investing in technology to improve operations can create a virtuous circle of savings and improved customer experience. examples include scan-and-go payment technologies, smart shelves, radio-frequency identification and predictive ordering and replenishment. master the last mile and supply chain resilience consumers want faster and cheaper home delivery. hema set a new standard when it offered home delivery 30 minutes from ordering (within a 3-kilometer radius). that's a challenge to e-commerce economics around the world but particularly so in asia-pacific, given its geographic diversity. there isn2019t a single fulfillment model that can span the regional differences in e-commerce demand, urban density, real estate market dynamics, labor costs and logistical maturity.retailers will instead need to tailor their last-mile approach to local condition. for instance, highly centralized and automated fulfillment centers work well in sydney, with its expensive real estate and workers; its logistical maturity is also ideal for home delivery by truck. shanghai suits a mix of centralized and hyperlocal fulfillment, trucks and nimbler

3rd-Party - 2020 Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index (Jul-20).pdf,"The third installment of KPMGs Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index (AVRI) ranks the preparedness of 30 countries to support autonomous vehicles. Five new countries have been added to the roster from 2019, and some countries moved downward as a result. The AVRI uses 28 different measures organized into four pillars: policy and legislation, technology and innovation, infrastructure, and consumer acceptance. Singapore, The Netherlands, and Norway occupy the top 3 spots.","autonomous vehicles readiness index (avri) is a tool to help measure the level of preparedness for autonomous vehicles across 30 countries and jurisdictions. it is a composite index that combines 28 individual measures from a range of sources into a single score. more information on the results, methodology and sources used can be found in the appendix.the intended core audience for the avri is public sector organizations with responsibility for transport and infrastructure. it should also be of interest to other public and private sector organizations that are involved with, or make use of, road transport.this report uses the term 2018 autonomous vehicles , abbreviated to avs, to refer to the technology used both within vehicles and externally, such as digital networks and road infrastructure. it also uses avs to refer to vehicles that can do everything a traditional vehicle does without human intervention, sometimes described as  level five automation , where vehicles are fully self-driving and the human driver becomes a passenger.the terms av and driverless car are used interchangeably, although this report also covers autonomous buses and trucks. the following abbreviations are also used in the text: ai for artificial intelligence, ev for electric vehicle(s), lidar for light detection and ranging technologies and iot for internet of things.us dollar equivalents for local currencies are as of early june 2020.foreword richard threlfall on how the avri has evolved and what av adoption will mean for society.introduction: enabling the av revolution overcoming the challenges of safety, privacy, digital infrastructure, transport systems and cross-border travel.milestones key events in the development of avs over 2019 and 2020 to date.executive summary overview of the top five ranked countries and jurisdictions, methodology updates, and other key highlights.national profiles profiles of all 30 countries and jurisdictions, summarizing results, key initiatives by governments and businesses, and drawing on the insights of kpmg's national av experts.cities to watcha look at five hyper connected cities and what they are doing to pave a future for avs.the road to ubiquity key takeaways and actionable insights for governments and policy makers. appendix: results and methodology detail on the data and methodology used to build we first published the autonomous vehicles readiness index in 2018, there was widespread excitement around the technology, reflected in frequent media coverage. this has since reduced significantly and the casual observer could conclude that perhaps it was all hype after all, and that the autonomous revolution remains decades away. the reality however is that av technology is entering a period of development maturity, during which the complex challenges of implementation are being addressed. the transformational potential of av technology remains immense. according to the data gathered for the third avri and insights from specialists within kpmg's network of national firms, significant progress has been made on the extensive work needed to allow avs to operate safely and effectively in our societies, including overhauling regulations and running large-scale tests. we are also seeing avs move into use around the world in public transport and in closed-site environments such as mining and logistics. and national and local governments are finding distinctive ways to introduce them. this edition of the avri adds five new countries and jurisdictions: belgium, chile, denmark, italy and taiwan. it lightly refreshes the measures used to assess each country and jurisdiction to account for our increased understanding of some of the key enablers of avs, such as telecommunications. the indicators remain organized by the same four pillars as the first two reports policy and legislation, technology and innovation, infrastructure and consumer acceptance. as some countries and jurisdictions devolve responsibility for transport to local authorities, this year's report also features coverage of five notable cities beijing, detroit, helsinki, pittsburgh and seoul 2014 which are undertaking ground-breaking work at a municipal level.the third avri sees singapore swap places with the netherlands to claim the top position in the index. since the start of 2019 the city-state has taken a number of significant steps to encourage the testing, development and adoption of avs, such as opening a tenth of its roads for testing. like several other highly-ranked countries, singapore has embedded avs into wider goals, including greater use of public transport, wider use of evs and economic development from research-focused jobs.as in previous editions, many national scores are very close and many countries and jurisdictions have opportunities to make progress. demonstrating this, of the 25 in the 2019 index, 17 have increased their score. by providing assessments of strengths, challenges and recommendations, this report aims to provide constructive insights that can help governments learn from each other and improve.the coronavirus pandemic has led to several av trials being suspended, but it is possible to imagine the contribution this technology could make if it were further developed, from maintaining delivery networks to providing more flexible, less crowded public transport such as through the use of smaller, on-demand minibuses.i continue to see avs as enabling an impending revolution that will strengthen our societies and economies, while making the world's roads safer and more accessible to everyone. enabling the av revolution safety this third edition of the autonomous vehicles readiness index shows that over the last year countries and the world health organization estimates that there are jurisdictions have been grappling with the key policy 1.35 million road deaths and 50 million injuries annually. and investment decisions needed in order to enable with human error responsible in around 95 percent of the av revolution. some differences have emerged in cases, avs have the potential to reduce these casualties proposed approaches, but countries and jurisdictions dramatically. at a global ministerial conference on road are also learning from each other and engaging with the automotive companies and technology businesses that are developing the technology, as kpmg recommended in the first index.key enablers include safety, privacy, digital infrastructure, impact on transport systems and cross-border travel. we consider each in turn. safety held in stockholm in february 2020, participants recognized that advanced vehicle safety technologies are among the most effective of all automotive safety devices and called for countries to ensure that all vehicles sold by 2030 include safety performance technology.1 although avs are much safer than human drivers, governments are understandably concerned to ensure that av technology is as safe as possible.the united states provides less protection at a federal level, although states including california have recently tightened their rules. some countries including china place less importance on privacy as a result of a more communal approach.this means the data that avs and other connected vehicles collect and transmit is likely to vary substantially from country to country. for those with strict data protection rules, vehicles will need to anonymize data and minimize what is passed on, while other jurisdictions may require avs to tell the authorities where they are at all times. kpmg anticipates however that over time the majority of countries will move to some form of data collection from connected vehicles in order to ensure the most efficient use of road space.digital infrastructure there is debate over how much effort countries and jurisdictions should put into digital infrastructure for avs, including sensor networks, roadside equipment such as smart traffic lights that can tell avs when to stop or go, and high-quality digital mapping.level four avs, which are only capable of autonomy in certain conditions, may be geo-fenced, or geographically limited, to areas with adequate digital infrastructure. we overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles, said ford's chief executive officer jim hackett in april 2019, adding that the company's first av was still planned for 2021 but it's applications will be narrow, what we call geo-fenced, because the problem is so complex.5 but if this generation of avs require sensors, on-road equipment and detailed mapping to work well, their popularity and use will be limited to areas that can afford and have invested in such infrastructure.from a safety point of view, level five avs should not need to rely on external infrastructure to operate. however their safety is likely to come at the cost of efficiency, with a number of studies suggesting slower traffic speeds and worse congestion with avs because they will drive more defensively than humans. digital infrastructure, allowing vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, is potentially the solution to this. v2i systems use a centralized traffic management system to optimize the use of a region's highways by orchestrating how vehicles operate for the benefit of all users. the swedish government emphasized the vision zero approach it adopted in 1997, which aims that no-one is killed or suffers lifelong injuries from road traffic accidents.2 in apparent criticism of vehicle makers rushing vehicles with limited autonomy to market, hakan samuelsson, the chief executive of swedish-based vehicle maker volvo, said in march 2019: we have a responsibility and everybody who's in this business has that responsibility, because otherwise you're going to kill a technology that might be the best lifesaver in the history of the car.sweden's safety-focused approach will almost certainly be followed by most other authorities. the outcry following the tragic death of a pedestrian in phoenix, arizona who was killed by an av in 2019 shows that society has a very low tolerance for accidents caused by technology, and governments will set policy accordingly. but there is a risk that setting the safety bar too high for avs will slow their introduction and lead to many more people dying on roads from human error in the meantime. privacy avs present a particular dilemma around data privacy. for public authorities, one of the great opportunities of connected vehicles is the optimization of road capacity. if they know the position and destination of all vehicles in a particular area, an intelligent traffic management system can set the speeds and routes of all these vehicles in order to minimize journey times and congestion levels. but doing so requires vehicle tracking and sharing of personal information in a way which in many cultures is currently regarded as politically unacceptable. some companies may also be wary of involvement in such work for similar reasons.countries already diverge significantly over the extent to which they protect the privacy of road users. the european union has strict privacy standards as a result of the general data protection regulation (gdpr).this means potentially different av operating scenarios. in areas where road capacity is unconstrained, for example in rural areas, avs may rely more on their own systems. in areas where capacity is constrained, for example in cities and on major highways between cities, it will be more important for governments to invest in digital infrastructure and require avs to interface with the systems they establish. impact on transport systems the highest-profile work on av development, led by technology companies based in the us, has focused on driverless private cars and taxi services. if these predominate, the result is likely to be more vehicles on roads. however, many countries and jurisdictions are using avs to increase the convenience and popularity of shared transport. this includes trials and regular services of slow-moving driverless minibuses in countries including chile, denmark, finland and norway. spain is trialing such vehicles for tourism in an environmentally sensitive area of the canary islands while australia is using them in a retirement village. this focus on public transport is gradually being scaled up, with operators in singapore, spain and the uk testing full-length autonomous buses. this will reduce the need for professional drivers. the transport department of taipei in taiwan is planning to start on-road trials of av buses at night to help solve a driver shortage, and bus drivers in singapore are being trained as bus safety operators under the city-state's plan to introduce driverless buses from 2022. as avs cut labor costs, they make services for remote communities more affordable, as well as allowing better public transport in crowded cities.the coronavirus pandemic could also boost the case for the adoption of avs. the disease has made shared vehicles less attractive to users, but a regularly-cleaned publicly-managed av minibus might look like a better option than a vehicle from a private ride-hailing service. in other industries, the pandemic has increased both demand and opportunity for automation, and in a few cases avs have been brought into use for this reason.6 they have generally been used to make deliveries rather than transport people, such as healthcare provider mayo clinic and florida's jacksonville transportation authority using four avs to move tests from a drive-through location to a lab, with no human supervision on isolated routes.7 traveling across borders although countries and jurisdictions may differ in how much digital infrastructure they deploy for avs, they should ensure it works for any vehicle that is likely to use it. this means international standardization to allow avs to operate in other countries, at least within the same continent. within the european union, some basic automation will become mandatory in all new vehicles under the advanced driver assistance systems (adas) from 2022, including autonomous emergency braking and assistance in staying in lanes. it would make sense for similar international standardization to cover v2i. the same is true of insurance. some countries have already legislated to clarify liability in relation to avs, including the uk's automated and electric vehicles act. but with such vehicles potentially capable of moving autonomously across national borders, it would be helpful to have a degree of consistency in legislative approach.the international community is not always a model of coordination, as the coronavirus pandemic and climate change are demonstrating. however, despite significant differences in what countries and jurisdictions want to achieve with avs, there are plenty of areas where all can benefit from an aligned approach.president tsai apple buys drive.ai, ing-wen opens the a silicon valley-based the

3rd-Party - Bank of England CFO Survey (June-20).pdf,"This routine survey from the BoE provides an insight into how the Chief Financial Officers from various industries see the impact of Covid-19. Although only UK companies are surveyed, the key sectoral concerns related to the impact of coronavirus can, to some extent, be applied universally. Overall, the situation remains serious with the expectation of double-digit declines in sales and investment extending into Q1 2021. Sales in the consumer-facing services sector are expected to still be about 16% below what they would normally have been in Q1 2021. In other sectors, sales are expected to be around 8% lower.","latest results from the decision maker panel survey - 2020 q 2 the decision maker panel (dmp) is a survey of chief financial officers from small, medium and large uk businesses. we use it to monitor developments in the economy and to track business views. this is a summary of the results up until may 2020. in the mdmp survey, firms expected their sales in 2020 q2, on average, to be 42% lower due to covid-19 compared with what they would normally have expected, employment to be 6% lower and investment to be 43% lower (chart 1). the sales and investment impacts were a little smaller than in the april survey (where they were 44% and 50% respectively). and the employment impact in 2020 q2 was materially smaller than in the april survey (a fall of 6% vs 18%). that possibly reflects the extension of the government's job retention scheme, which was only due to run until may at the time of april survey. the percentage of furloughed employees was reported to be around 35% in both the april and may surveys.the may survey asked businesses about their expectations for the impact of covid-19 over the next year as well as inq2. a gradual recovery in sales was expected over the next year but some of the effects of covid-19 were likely to be persistent. the negative impact of coronavirus on sales was expected to decline from around 40% in q2 to around 30% , around 20% in q4 and around 10% in q1 of next year (chart 1). investment was expected to recover more slowly than sales and to be around 20% below what it would have been in q1 of next year. the impact on employment is expected to be larger in the second half of this year than in q2, with the biggest impact expected to be around -10% .chart 1 covid-19 was expected to have a large impact on firms 2019 sales, employment and investment over the next year  the results are based on the questions  relative to what would otherwise have happened, what is your best estimate for the impact of the spread of coronavirus (covid-19) on the sales, employment and capital expenditure of your business in each of the following periods?2019 respondents provided their expected impacts for 2020 q2, 2020 q3, 2020 q4 and 2021 q1. bank of england page 3 sectoral analysis the impact of covid-19 was expected to be substantial across all sectors, but highly consumer-facing businesses expected to be most severely affected.the analysis in this section divides firms into four groups based on the nature of the industry that they are in: highly consumer-facing non-essential services 2013 including firms from non-food retail, accommodation and food and recreational services sectors less consumer-facing non-essential services 2013 for example, companies in finance and real estate,professional services and information and communication 037e non-food manufacturing and construction 037e and businesses involved in the provision of essential services 2013 food manufacturing and distribution, utilities and healthcare.chart 2 highlights how highly consumer-facing services expected the biggest falls in sales in q2, in the region of 60%(shown by the red bars). non-food manufacturing and construction was the next most affected sector with sales expected to fall by an average of around 45% (the dark brown bars) followed by less consumer-facing services (blue bars, a 30% falling sales). essential services expected the smallest impact on sales in q2 (shown by the light brown bars).chart 2 largest sales impacts in 2020 q2 were expected in highly consumer-facing services (a)(a) see footnote for chart 1.some recovery in sales was expected for all sectors over the next year, although sales were expected to remain below normal in 2021 q1, particularly in the highly consumer-facing services sector (chart 3). by q1 of next year, sales in the consumer-facing services sector were expected to still be about 16% below what they would normally have been. in other sectors, sales were expected to recover to closer to normal: by q1, sales were expected to be around 8% lower, on average.latest results from the decision maker panel survey 2010 2020 q2 | bank of england page 4 chart 3 sales impacts expected to remain largest in consumer-facing industries over the next year (a)(a) see footnote for chart 1.alongside a reduction in sales, firms across all sectors expected covid-19 to reduce capital expenditure over the next year. businesses providing highly consumer-facing services reported that they expected the largest hits to investment(chart 4), consistent with the sector expecting to experience the largest and most persistent impact on sales.chart 4 all sectors expected persistently lower investment, but particularly consumer-facing sectors see footnote for chart 1.businesses in highly consumer-facing industries also expected the largest reduction in employment over the next year. while all sectors reported a material reduction in employment in 2020 q2 of around 5% or just above, there was more divergence in expectations over the second half of the year. in particular, highly consumer-facing firms expected to make further substantial cuts in employment during this period while changes in other sectors were expected to be more modest.chart 5 consumer-facing sectors also expected to make the largest cuts in employment, particularly in the second half of the year see footnote for chart 1.consumer-facing firms had also reported placing the largest share of their employees on furlough in may. around 60% of employees in firms in that sector were reported to be on furlough (chart 6). as a result, the phasing out of the government's job retention scheme (where employers have to make

3rd-Party - Cost of Privacy - Welfare Effects from Disclosure of COVID-19 Cases (Jul-20).pdf,"An interesting contribution to a Public Safety debate in how best to protect the public from Covid-19 infections. Earlier this year, authorities in Seoul publicly disclosed detailed location information of unnamed individuals that tested positive for COVID-19. After measuring the resulting changes in commuting patterns, the authors argue these strategies are likely to decrease transmission in a way comparable to city-wide lockdowns but with reduced negative economic consequences. Public dissemination of infected individuals location may achieve both goals simultaneously, albeit at the price of privacy loss.","abstract south korea publicly disclosed detailed location information of individuals that tested positive for covid-19. we quantify the effect of public disclosure on the transmission of the virus and economic losses in seoul. the change in commuting patterns due to public disclosure lowers the number of cases by 200 thousand and the number of deaths by 7.7 thousand in seoul over two years. compared to a city-wide lock-down that results in the same number of cases over two years as the disclosure scenario, the economic cost of such a lockdown is almost four times higher.  Introduction on january 30, 2020, residents of jungnang district in northeast seoul received the following message on their cellphone about the second person in south korea that tested positive for covid:  korean male, born 1987, living in jungnang district. confirmed on january 30,hospitalized in seoul medical center.The text went on to disclose the whereabouts of the individual in the past few days :2022 january 24: return trip from wuhan without symptoms.2022 january 26: merchandise store  at myeongdong by subway at 12pm; massage spa  by subway in afternoon; two convenience stores  and two supermarkets 2217. 12022 january 27: restaurant 2217 and two supermarkets in afternoon.2022 january 28: hair salon  inn seongbuk; supermarket  and restaurant  in jungnang by bus; wedding shop in gangnam by subway; home by subway.2022 january 29: tested at hospital in jungnang.over the following weeks, as more people were tested for covid, south koreans received similar texts for every relevant patient that tested positive. this information was widely disseminated on websites and incorporated into mobile phone applications.this paper uses south korea's experience to show that public disclosure can be an important tool to combat the spread of a virus. since a testing regime is likely to only catch a fraction of infected individuals, disclosure of locations of people that have tested positive can help non-infected people avoid places where they are more likely to be in contact with infected people that have not yet been detected. for example, on march 30, local authorities in seoul disclosed that a patient visited a cup fee shop in mapo district on march 28. nobody visited the cob  shop on may 30.2 if the person who visited the coffee shop on march 28 infected others in the vicinity, this behavior by the public can help reduce the probability that an infected person spreads the virus.figure 1 shows that the response of the public to the disclosure of the visit by the infected person to the coffee shop in mapo district may hold more generally. the figure uses daily data on commuting flows between neighborhoods in seoul from south korea's largest mobile phone company.3 it shows the mean and the 95 percent confidence interval of the change in the number of commuters from other districts of seoul, relative to the first week for february, in each of the 25 districts in seoul during the weekdays. we highlight two facts.first, commuter in owls in the average district in seoul decreased by about 10% in march an asterisk 2217 indicates that the establishment's name was disclosed. seoul's radical experiment in digital contact tracing, the new yorker, april 17, 2020. We describe the mobile phone data in section 3.1and april and recovered by the end of may. second, there is substantial heterogeneity across districts in the change in commuting in ows. at the peak of the pandemic in early march,in ows fell by more than 20% in some districts but by only 5% in other districts. in late may when in owls in the average district were back to normal ,  rows into some districts appear to be permanently lower while in other districts, the reverse is true. we show that commuting in ows fell by more in districts with a large number of covid patients lived or visited compared to districts with few covid patients.figure 1: change in weekday in rows into districts in seoul note: the figure shows the mean and the 95 percent confidence interval of the percent change in the inflow of people into each district of the city of seoul, relative to the first week of february, calculated from sk telecom's mobile phone data.we then quantify the effect of the change in commuting flows in seoul shown in figure 1 on the transmission of the virus. we use a sir model where the virus spreads as susceptible people in a neighborhood commute and come into contact with infected people from other neighborhoods. we show that the change in commuting flows observed in mobile phone location data predicts the heterogeneous spread of the virus across neighborhoods in seoul.we also project the effect of public disclosure on the transmission of the virus over the next two years. relative to a scenario where there are no changes in commuting patterns, public disclosure of information lowers the number of covid patients by 200 thousand over two years.we also endogenize the commuting flows in the sir model. in the model, the flow of people across neighborhoods generates economic gains from the optimal match of people with the place of work and leisure. we use the economic commuting model to estimate the economic losses from the disruption of commuting flows shown in figure 1. over the next two years, the predicted disruption in commuting patterns under south korea's current strategy will lower economic welfare an average 0.15 percent per day compared to a scenario with no changes in commuting flows.we then compare south korea's current strategy to a hypothetical lockdown that results in the same number of infections over the next two years. there are two advantages of disclosure strategy relative to a lockdown. first, a lockdown does not discriminate between locations. all  shops are shut down, not only the ones visited by people who later tested positive for covid. second, a lockdown forces everybody into social isolation, irrespective of the cost the lockdown imposes on them. in contrast, in our model, people self-select into social distancing based on their perceived risks from covid and costs of social distancing.as a consequence, under a lockdown, optimal  commuting patterns are severely disrupted for a large number of people and the cost of the disruption is about four times as large as inthe disclosure scenario.our approach combines the sir metapopulation model, where movements of the population transmit the virus across space, with a quantitative model of internal city structure asin ahlfeldt et al. (2015), where the flows of people across the city are endogenous. recent papers that develop a similar model are antr`as et al. (2020), fajgelbaum et al. (2020) andcu02dcnat and zymek (2020). our work differs in that, in our model, commuting costs depend on the local information and we use detailed mobile phone data to discipline the sensitivity of commuting flows to information about covid cases. we do not study the optimal control problem as do recent papers on the covid-19 pandemic by alvarez et al. (2020) and farboodi et al. (2020). instead, we focus on comparing the policy of disclosing information to both a policy without information disclosure and to a lockdown policy.the paper proceeds as follows. section 2 presents the sir model with commuting choices.section 3 discusses the data and how we calibrate the parameters of the model. in section 4 we compare our benchmark model with one with no disclosure and one with a lockdown.section 5 concludes.32 sir model with endogenous population flows in this section, we develop a model where the virus spreads across neighborhoods due to commuting flows, and where the commuting flows are the endogenous outcome of individuals maximizing their utility by choosing where to work and to enjoy their leisure. specifically, we adopt the canonical meta-population sir (susceptible-infected-recovered) model to analyze how the release of public information of covid-19 cases affects the spread of the virus inseoul.4 individuals live in different neighborhoods in seoul and the virus spreads when they commute to other neighborhoods. they can also choose to stay at home. in that case, they don't interact with other people and, as a result, the virus does not spread.specifically, there is an exogenous number of individuals in each neighborhood. individuals are classified as susceptible (s; at risk of contracting the disease), infectious (i; capable of transmitting the disease), quarantined (q; infected but quarantined and not transmitting the disease), and recovered (r; those who recover or die from the disease). we further differentiate individuals by age and residential neighborhood i. time t is defined as a day. we will show later that commuting flows are different in the weekday vs. the weekend. because of this, we distinguish between the days that fall on weekdays vs. weekends. in the absence of these flows, a susceptible person does not come into contact with an infected person. when a susceptible person comes into physical contact with an infected person, the matching parameter 03b2 denotes the probability the susceptible person gets infected.5 the second and third terms in equation 1 are the infected that recover (or die) and the infected that are detected and quarantined, respectively, and the exogenous parameters are the recovery rate of infected people 03b3 and the detection rate di.64see keeling et al. (2010), keeling and rohani (2011)5the home sector is one of the destinations. once a susceptible person chooses to stay at home, she doesn't  get infected.7 we assume individuals make commuting choices every day and we distinguish between weekdays and weekends.in the absence of a pandemic, we assume that commuting costs only depends on the travel distance between i and j. we incorporate the effect of disclosure of covid cases on commuting flows during the pandemic by assuming that the cost of commuting to neighborhood also depends on information about the number of infected individuals in that neighborhood.an individual's commuting choice then boils down to a discrete choice problem. given her idiosyncratic productivity, she chooses to work during the weekday in the neighborhood that maximizes her income net of the commuting cost. similarly, given her idiosyncratic preferences, she chooses the neighborhood that maximizes her leisure net of the commuting cost during the weekend. expected utility of residents of neighborhood i is a harmonic mean of the mean parameter of the frechet distribution in all neighborhoods and decreasing in the cost of all accessing neighborhoods from location i. expected welfare differs between residents of different neighborhoods depending on commuting costs from that neighborhood to all the other neighborhoods of the city. we refer to the weighted average of equations 5 and 6 across the residents in all the neighborhoods of seoul economic welfare.8in summary, the total number of detected cases and visits that are publicly disclosed affect the commuting costs to each neighborhood, as specified in equation 2. the changes in commuting costs are reflected in the commuting flows (equations 3 and 4) and affect not only the spread of the virus through their feedback into the sir dynamics (equation 1), but also individuals economic welfare (equations 5 and 6). the model highlights the important trade-offs of the public disclosure policy. the availability of information increases the commuting costs and lowers economic welfare, since it disrupts the optimal match of people with the place of work and leisure, but it also reduces the transmission of the virus appendix a for a derivation of equations 3-6.6across neighborhoods.3 model calibration and simulation in this section, we describe the data we use and how we calibrate the parameters of the modeling the previous section. we then simulate the effect of the disclosure of information on the transmission of the virus and economic losses in seoul over the next two years.3.1 calibration we infer the economic parameters from data on commuting flows. we measure commuting brows from proprietary data provided by the sk telecom mobile phone company.9 based on the location of mobile phones, sk telecom calculates daily bilateral flows of people by age group and gender between the 25 districts of seoul.10 we have data on daily bilateral commuting flows across seoul's districts from january 2020 to may 2020. we also have the data on the monthly average of daily bilateral commuting flows from january 2019 to december 2019, which we will use to calibrate parameters related to the pre-pandemic period.commuting flows during the weekend are more sensitive to distance compared to commutes during the weekdays.1the variance of a person's productivity across districts is larger than the variance of her preferences for leisure across districts. it also implies that the responsiveness of weekend flows to a given change in commuting costs will be larger than that of the weekday flows.we next use the equation for the commuting flows during the pandemic to estimate how the commuting costs change in response to disclosure of information on covid cases.13this is the value estimated from early evidence from covid cases in china reported in wang et al.(2020).103.2 simulation of sir commuting model we now simulate the sir commuting model over two years assuming public disclosure of all vivid cases. our initial conditions are the first 4 cases confirmed in the city of seoul placed at the districts where the people infected reside. since 90% of the cases are undetected, our initial conditions are a total of 4 cases in quarantine and 36 cases undetected. the infected people that are undetected follow the predicted commuting patterns of the model. the first day of the simulation is january 30th, 2020. in the data disclosed by local authorities,infected people who are detected report visiting two distinct districts on average in their entire travel logs.we first evaluate the performance of the sir model in terms of explaining the heterogeneity in the spread of the virus across neighborhoods in seoul. panel (a) of figure 2 plots the cumulative number of reported covid in each district in seoul by the end of may against the model's prediction of the number of cases in each district. the figure shows that the model is able to replicate well the geographical spread of the disease, as most dots are close to the 45 degree line. panel (b) of figure 2 shows the dynamics of infected people that will take place in the upcoming months as predicted by the model. the figure shows that according to our model, infection increases up to around day 400 and decreases after then. the peak of infection will involve less than 3% of the population at the same time. relative to the people below 60 years of age, there are less people above 60 years of age that are infected at a given point in time. this is because older people are more likely to stay at the home sector and respond more to information on the number of confirmed cases and visits in each district.panel (c) of figure 2 shows the change in  rows by district during weekdays and weekends. as disease spreads, inflows to each district decline. at the peak of disease, average are 11 percent lower during weekdays and 24 percent lower during weekends. consistent with empirical evidence in figure 1, we also find significant heterogeneity across districts in the change in fl rows in each district. this can be seen in the 95 percent confidence interval of the change in inflows into each district. panel (d) of figure 2 shows the change in economic welfare, aggregating weekdays and weekends and residents of different neighborhoods of seoul. economic welfare declines because workers realize the cost of getting infected and change their commuting behavior. at the peak of disease, economic welfare declines by 0.3percent.11 figure 2: simulated effect of

the change in economic welfare as a 7-day moving average.4 welfare effects of disclosure in this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of information disclosure and lockdown. first,to quantify the effectiveness of the disclosure policy, we simulate the model without allowing commuting to respond to information. this can be interpreted as the case without information disclosure or, alternatively, the case where people cannot change their commuting behavior despite of information. we believe the first interpretation is closer to the real world given the observed changes in commuting behavior from the daily bilateral commuting data.second, we quantify the effectiveness of a lockdown policy, another widely used mitigation strategy, relative to the information disclosure case.as described in the previous section, detailed information disclosure can be summarized into two components: (i) the total number of confirmed cases in each district for the past two weeks, cj(t), and (ii) total number of visits by confirmed cases to each of the districts for the past two weeks, vj(t). we first examine the no information disclosure case, in which both cj(t) and vj(t) are not available. in this case, the commuting flow equation depends only on the physical distance from origin to destination. then, we evaluate a partial disclosure case, where either cj(t) or vj(t) is not disclosed; the partial disclosure case reported below are the chained results of these two scenarios.table 2 reports the total number of detected cases, the total number of death, and the economic welfare losses over two years under different disclosure policies. under partial and no information disclosure, we find more detected cases. the difference between the full information disclosure and partial or no disclosure scenarios is also significant when comparing the total number of deaths. the scenario with no disclosure of information yields 42 percent more the number of deaths compared to the full disclosure scenario. this is because individuals above 60 years of age, those that are more vulnerable to the virus, are also more sensitive to the information disclosed and altered their commuting patterns significantly in response.the public health benefits from information disclosure come at the cost of economic welfare losses. we calculate average economic welfare loss per day compared to the non disclosure case. the daily economic welfare loss for the young (old) is 0.04 (0.05) percent under partial disclosure and "
3rd-Party - COVID-19 Reallocation Shock (May-20).pdf,"An economics research paper from the U of Chicago makes several interesting predictions: 1) Even if medical advances or natural forces bring an early resolution to the COVID-19 crisis, many shifts in consumer demand and business practices will persist 2) the crisis halted economic expansion and has hastened the exit and contraction of marginal businesses, in an example of 'cleansing dynamics' 3) Persistent concerns about disease transmission will provide strong impetus for new products and efforts to allay customer concerns about infection risks. Driverless taxis are one possibility.","abstract drawing on firm-level expectations at a one-year forecast horizon in the survey of business uncertainty (sbu), we construct novel, forward-looking reallocation measures for jobs and sales. these measures rise sharply after february 2020, reaching rates in april that are 2.4 (3.9) times the pre-covid average for jobs (sales). we also draw on special questions in the april sbu to quantify the near-term impact of the covid-19 shock on business staffing. we find 3 new hires for every 10 layoffs caused by the shock and estimate that 42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss. our survey evidence aligns well with anecdotal evidence of large pandemic-induced demand increases at some firms, with contemporaneous evidence on gross business formation, and with a sharp pandemic-induced rise in equity return dispersion across firms. after developing the evidence, we consider implications of our evidence for the economic outlook and for policy responses to the pandemic. unemployment benefit levels that exceed worker earnings, policies that subsidize employee retention, occupational licensing restrictions, and regulatory barriers to business formation will impede reallocation responses to the covid-19 shock. the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to contain the virus are exacting a staggering economic toll in countries around the world. china's economy shrank 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year basis, and eurozone economies shrank at a14.8 percent annualized rate. in the united states, nearly 28 million persons filed new claims for unemployment benefits over the six-week period ending april 25.1 the u.s. economy shrank at an annualized rate of 4.8 percent in the first quarter of 2020, and many analysts project it will shrink at a rate of 25% or more in the second quarter.2 yet, even as much of the economy is shuttered, some firms are expanding in response to pandemic-induced demand shifts. as noted in a recent wall street journal article, 201cthe coronavirus pandemic is forcing the fastest reallocation of labor since world war ii, with companies and governments mobilizing an army of idled workers into new activities that are urgently needed.201d3 in other words, covid-19 is also a major reallocation shock. we develop evidence on the extent and character of this reallocation shock for the u.s. economy. we start with anecdotal evidence, drawing on news reports and other sources. anecdotal evidence is useful for its immediacy, as a source of hypotheses, and for insights into broader forces. next, we turn to the survey of business uncertainty (sbu) to construct novel, forward-looking measures of expected sales and job reallocation across american firms at a one-year look-ahead horizon. the sbu is a monthly panel survey developed and fielded by the federal reserve bank of atlanta in cooperation with chicago booth and stanford. we use firm-level employment forecasts in the sbu to calculate the following quantity: the gross expected job gains at firms that anticipate growing over the next year plus the gross expected job losses at firms that anticipate shrinking minus the absolute value of the net change obtained by summing over all the forecasts. we activity weight the firm-level forecasts in this calculation and divide by aggregate employment to obtain the expected excess job reallocation rate at a one-year look-ahead horizon. this statistic quantifies the volume of cross-firm job reallocation in excess of the amount needed to accommodate the aggregate net change. it is the 1 the unemployment claims data are available at . 2 as of 31 march, goldman sachs projects that u.s. gdp will fall 34 percent (annualized) in the second quarter of 2020 (carew, 2020). baker, bloom, davis and terry (2020) obtain a similar figure using the estimates implied by an empirical model of disaster effects that baker, bloom and terry (2020) fit to historical data for 38 countries. according to blue chip economic indicators report of 10 april 2020, the mean forecast for u.s. gdp is a 24.5 percent (annualized) drop in the second quarter of 2020. 3 the quotation is from bender and dalton (2020). 1 forward-looking analog to the backward-looking measures of excess job reallocation examined in dunne, roberts and samuelson (1989) and davis and haltiwanger (1992).4 our measure of the expected excess job reallocation rate rises from 1.5 percent of employment in january 2020 to 5.4 percent in april. the april value is 2.4 times the pre-covid average and is, by far, the highest value in the short history of the series. we also use firm-level sales forecasts in the sbu to compute the expected excess sales reallocation rate at a one-year forecast horizon. expected sales reallocation shows a similar time-series pattern, reaching values in march and april that are four times the pre-pandemic average. thus, our expected excess reallocation rate measures support the view that covid-19 is a major reallocation shock. we also quantify the near-term reallocative impact of pandemic-related developments on business staffing. for this purpose, we draw on two special questions fielded in the april 2020 sbu. one question asks (as of mid-april) about the coronavirus impact on own-company staffing since 1 march 2020, and another asks about the anticipated impact over the ensuing four weeks. cumulating responses over firms and across these two questions, the data say that pandemic-related developments caused near-term layoffs equal to 12.8 percent of march 1 employment and new hires equal to 3.8 percent. in other words, the covid-19 shock caused 3 new hires in the near term for every 10 layoffs. these sizable new hires amidst a tremendous overall contraction align well with our anecdotal evidence of large pandemic-induced increases in demand at certain firms. weekly statistics on gross business formation derived from u.s. administrative data also point to creation and gross hiring activity, even in the near-term wake of the pandemic. next, we consider time-series evidence on the dispersion in monthly equity returns across u.s.-listed firms. return dispersion relates less directly to future reallocation activity, but its availability over several decades helps us put the covid-19 episode in perspective. whether measured by the interquartile range or the standard deviation of returns in the value-weighted distribution, the dispersion in equity returns jumps sharply in march 2020, reaching levels last 4 many later studies consider backward-looking job reallocation measures. see davis and haltiwanger (1999) for a review. for applications of analogous backward-looking reallocation measures to other outcomes, see dell2019ariccia and garibaldi (2005) and craig and haubrich (2013) on bank lending, eisfeldt and rampini (2006) on physical capital, davis et al. (2009) on sales, broda and weinstein (2010) on consumer products, iacovone and jovorcik (2010) on export products, herrera, kolar and minetti (2011) on business credit, and afonso and lagos (2015) on the federal funds market. 2 seen during the financial crisis of 2008-09 and the dot.com bust of the early 2000s. these three episodes exhibit the highest return dispersion in our sample period, which starts in 1984. after presenting the evidence, we consider implications for the economic outlook and for policy responses to the pandemic. even if medical advances or natural forces bring an early resolution to the crisis, many pandemic-induced shifts in consumer demand and business practices will persist. thus, much of the near-term reallocative impact of the pandemic will also persist, as indicated by our forward-looking reallocation measures. drawing on our survey evidence and historical evidence of how layoffs relate to recalls, we estimate that 42 percent of recent pandemic-induced layoffs will result in permanent job loss. if the pandemic and partial economic shutdown linger for many months, or if pandemics with serious health consequences and high mortality rates become a recurring phenomenon, there will be profound, long-term consequences for the reallocation of jobs, workers and capital across firms and locations. historically, creation responses to major reallocation shocks lag the destruction responses by a year or more. partly for this reason, we anticipate a drawn-out economic recovery from the covid-19 shock, even if the pandemic is largely controlled within a few months. multiple economic forces contribute to a delayed creation response, as we discuss. policy responses to major shocks and inherited features of the policy landscape can further stretch out the creation response, slowing the recovery. in this regard, we discuss four aspects of u.s. policy that can retard creation responses to the pandemic-induced reallocation shock: unemployment benefit levels that exceed earnings for many american workers under the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security (cares) act, policies that subsidize employee retention irrespective of the employer's longer term outlook, occupational licensing restrictions the impede mobility across occupations and states, and regulations that inhibit business formation and expansion. i. anecdotal evidence a. hiring and job reallocation recent news stories highlight the millions of layoffs triggered by the pandemic and lockdown. they also recount many examples of large-scale hiring. as of april 18, walmart hired 150,000 new employees in the span of a month and plans to hire 50,000 more (nassauer, 2020). likewise, amazon hired 100,000 new employees in recent weeks and aims to hire 3 another 75,000 (koetsler, 2020). dollar general plans to hire 50,000 new workers by the end of april.5 lowe's, the home improvement chain, aims to hire 30,000 new employees this spring (tyko, 2020). as of late march, many takeout and delivery-oriented firms are scrambling to hire workers. instacart, for example, is adding 300,000 shoppers to its payroll, and domino's is adding roughly 10,000 pizza delivery drivers (bender and dalton, 2020). papa john's plans to hire 20,000 new employees to meet heightened demand for pizza delivery in the wake of the pandemic (bandolm, 2020). outschool sought to hire 5,000 new teachers in the last two weeks of march to offer more online classes in light of school closures.6 some companies are forming partnerships that exploit the reallocative nature of the covid-19 shock to speed hiring. supermarket chain kroger created an exchange with sodexo, sysco and marriott international to hire workers laid off from food-service and hospitality firms. cvs healthcare is seeking to recruit 50,000 new staff by partnering with the hilton hotel chain, clothing retailer gap, and delta airlines (weber, 2020). uber now lists job openings at 7-eleven, amazon and mcdonald's and a dozen other companies for its unemployed drivers (lee, 2020). the near-term reallocative effects of the covid-19 shock are also evident in consumer spending patterns. the data analytics firm, earnest research, tracked credit card and debit card purchases for nearly six million americans to assess the impact of the covid-19 shock on consumer spending. for the week ending 1 april 2020, their data show that spending on airlines, hotels, rental cars, taxis, ride sharing and movie theaters is down 75-95 percent relative to spending in 2019 (leatherby and gelles, 2020). spending on fast food, auto parts, and autos is down 35 percent, and spending on apparel is down 70 percent. at the same time, spending on home improvement, video streaming, gaming, food delivery, meal kits, and online grocers has boomed. the bulk of these spending cuts and shifts will reverse when the pandemic recedes and the lockdown ends, but some aspects of the shift are likely to persist. 5 see . accessed on 19 april 2020. 6 see . accessed on 19 april 2020. 4 b. intra-industry reallocation perhaps because we often conceptualize the economy in terms of industries and regions, one might guess that pandemic-induced reallocation will mainly involve cross-industry and cross-region shifts. a large body of evidence suggests otherwise. idiosyncratic, employer-specific factors dominate gross job creation and destruction, while employment shifts between industries and regions account for only a small share of excess job reallocation. for example, when davis and haltiwanger (1992) split the u.s. manufacturing sector into about 450 four-digit standard industrial classifications, between-industry employment shifts account for only 13 percent of annual excess job reallocation during the 1970s and 1980s. when they split the manufacturing sector into roughly a thousand groups defined by the cross product of states and two-digit sics, between-group shifts account for only 14 percent of excess job reallocation. this type of finding has been replicated many times across countries, sectors and time periods.7 hence, we expect the bulk of the pandemic-induced reallocation response to occur within industries and regions. the restaurant industry provides a salient example of intra-industry reallocation in the current crisis. according to a survey conducted by the national restaurant association in late march, 3 percent of restaurant owners and operators have permanently closed in response to covid-19, and another 11 percent anticipate permanently closing within the next 30 days (taylor, 2020). applying these figures to the number of u.s. restaurants yields more than 100,000 permanent restaurant closures in the near-term wake of the covid-19 shock. at the same time, takeout and delivery-oriented chains are experiencing a huge demand boom, as illustrated by the anecdotes for domino's pizza and papa john's. much of this immediate reallocative impact will likely persist. turning to another salient example, an unsettled economy and uncertain outlook favor large incumbents with deep pockets. as cutter and thomas (2020) write in the wall street journal: 201cthe biggest players in tech are hoovering up talent in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. as some of silicon valley's most-promising startups lay off workers and others 7 davis and haltiwanger (1999, table 5) review evidence from studies that span thirteen countries. employment shifts between regions and industries account for less than 10 percent of excess job reallocation in half the studies and 10 to 20 percent in the rest. 5 freeze hiring, established companies including apple inc., alphabet inc.'s google and amazon.com inc. are pursuing software engineers, data scientists, product designers and others. facebook inc. says usage has spiked during the coronavirus crisis and it is committed to policing platforms ahead of the 2020 presidential election, so it will hire more than 10,000 people this year for critical roles on its product and engineering teams. the current moment may give well-capitalized tech companies a chance to poach skilled workers who until recently were gravitating to smaller upstarts, veteran technology recruiters say.201d these remarks suggest that the pandemic will induce a reallocation from smaller, younger tech firms to larger, established ones. a similar dynamic may play out in other industries as incumbents with deep pockets and established markets attract workers with newly-heightened concerns about job security. a third example highlights the role of new-found concerns about face-to-face interactions as a driver of intra-industry reallocation. in a recent article in medical economics, a publication aimed at healthcare professionals and business managers, mann (2020) remarks that telemedicine works 201cfor most medication refills 2026 urinary tract infections, colds and rashes, diabetes and hypertension follow-ups, lab results, post-op visits, birth control and fertility, and mental health.201d although a pandemic-induced shift to telemedicine may have little long-term impact on the net demand for medical services, some physician practices and medical clinics will respond adroitly to the shift, and many will not. horn (2020) offers an insightful glimpse into the commercial challenges presented by a partial shift to telemedicine. as his discussion suggests, there is high potential for a large reallocation of customers, revenues and workers across practices and clinics. a similar dynamic will play out in other professional, business, and personal services: some businesses will respond deftly to newly-intensified customer concerns about face-to-face interactions, and many will not. there are also well-documented examples of major past structural transformations that took the form of intra-industry reallocation. foster, haltiwanger and krizan (2006) attribute large productivity gains in the u.s. retail sector in the 1990s mainly to a reallocation from small retail outlets to larger, more productive stores operated by national chains. walmart, target, home depot, staples, barnes & noble and best buy played significant roles in this process, expanding at the expense of rivals. later, the rise of online shopping brought another major reallocation. in this regard, it's worth recalling that amazon began as an online bookseller, 6 eventually displacing rival booksellers who shifted online too little or too late. the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating the shift to online shopping, as illustrated by some of our anecdotes. ii. systematic evidence a. constructing forward-looking reallocation measures we construct forward-looking reallocation measures using data from the survey of business uncertainty (sbu), which samples senior executives in american firms at a monthly frequency. the sbu covers all 50 states, every major nonfarm industry, and a range of firm sizes. core survey questions elicit subjective forecast distributions over own-firm future outcomes at a one-year look-ahead horizon. (more precisely, the look-ahead horizon is twelve months for employment and four quarters for sales.) the survey instrument also gathers data for current and past outcomes. see altig et al. (2020b) for more information. let e\""#$,\""&'( denote the expected level of employment in month ) + 12 at firm - implied by its subjective forecast distribution at t. define the corresponding month-t expected employment growth rate at a 12-month look-ahead horizon as the arc percentage change. this growth rate measure is symmetric about zero, bounded between -2 and 2, and equal to log changes up to a second-order taylor series approximation. growth rates computed in this manner aggregate exactly when combined with suitable weights, given by the simple mean of initial and (expected) terminal levels. this approach to growth rate measurement and aggregation has become standard in the literature on business-level dynamics. see davis and haltiwanger (1999). where the first term on the right side is the expected gross job destruction rate over the 12-month forecast horizon, the second term is the expected gross job creation rate, and the third term is the absolute value of the expected net employment growth rate.9 we compute the expected excess sales reallocation rate at a four-quarter forecast horizon in an analogous manner.10 since we use sbu data to construct our forward-looking reallocation measures, we would like some assurance that the underlying firm-level data contain meaningful forecasts. in this regard, altig et al. (2020b) and barrero (2020) show that firm-level growth rate expectations in the sbu data are highly predictive of realized growth rates. using survey questions with the same design as the sbu questions, a revision underway of bloom et al. (2017) finds that plant-level growth rate expectations in the census bureau's manufacturing and organizational practices survey are also highly predictive of realized outcomes. these studies give us confidence that our forward-looking reallocation measures reflect meaningful forecasts of firm-level growth rates. that said, there are good reasons to think that our sbu-derived measures understate the expected reallocation rate on average, and that they also understate the rise in expected reallocation activity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. first, the sbu under samples younger firms, which have much higher reallocation rates than mature firms. see altig et al. (2020b) for further discussion of this point and references to the relevant literature. second, highly stressed firms are less likely to respond to surveys, which leads to an understatement of expected destruction activity.11 third, we cannot sample firms that will enter in the future, which leads to an understatement of expected creation activity. thus, we regard our estimates of forward-looking reallocation rates as conservative in terms of both average levels and the pandemic-induced response. 9 in practice, we winsorize the values at 500 and the (values at the 1st and 99th percentiles of the distribution of expected employment growth rates in data pooled over the period from october 2014 to december 2018. these thresholds follow altig et al. (2020b). 10 for sales, we winsorize at the 90th percentile of its distribution in the pooled sample from september 2016 to april 2020. we winsorize ( at the 1st and 99th percentiles of the distribution of expected sales growth rates in the pooled sample for the period from october 2014 to december 2018. see altig et al. (2020b) for an explanation of how we obtain arc percentage changes and implied levels of expected future sales from sbu data on the forecast distribution over future sales growth rates. 11 in line with this remark, the survey response rates among active sbu panelists are 57% in january 2020 60% in february, 57% in march and 52% in april, where 201cactive201d panelists are those who responded to the survey at least once in the previous six months. 8 b. expected excess reallocation rates table 1 reports average expected growth rates and excess reallocation rates from september 2016 to january 2020, before the covid-19 pandemic impacted the u.s. economy.12 the expected excess reallocation rate averages 0.97 percent for sales and 2.23 percent for jobs. figure 1 displays the expected excess job reallocation rate from october 2016 to april 2020, alongside the expected employment growth rate for the same 12-month forecast horizon. the expected excess reallocation rate rises from 1.54 percent in january 2020 to 5.39 percent in april, which is 2.4 times the pre-covid mean reported in table 1. the upward jump from march to april is the largest move in the short history of the series. figure 2 shows a broadly similar pattern for the expected sales reallocation rate, which jumps from 0.24 percent in january 2020 to 4.08 percent in march and 3.78 in april. these march and april values are also the highest in the history of the series, and they are about four times the pre-covid mean. in sum, our forward-looking relocation measures confirm that the covid-19 pandemic is a large reallocation shock. several other countries conduct surveys that could be used to construct forward-looking reallocation measures like the ones shown in figures 1 and 2. the u.k. decision maker panel, a monthly survey that began in august 2016, includes questions patterned after the ones in the sbu (bloom et al., 2018). surveys in germany, italy and japan also collect data on the expectations of firm-level variables. see guiso and parigi (1999), bachmann and elstner (2015), bachman et al. (2018), massenot and pettinichi (2018), tanaka et al. (2019) and chen et al. (2019). thus, it is feasible to construct forward-looking excess reallocation time series for several countries, which would be quite helpful in evaluating their predictive content and usefulness for policy makers. c. expected growth rates in the wake of the pandemic figures 1 and 2 also show the monthly paths of expected employment and sales growth rates for the period covered by the sbu. expected twelve-month employment growth fell about 2.2 percentage points from january to april 2020, and expected sales growth fell about 7.3 percentage points over the same period. while these statistics point to a sharp deterioration in the u.s. economic outlook in the wake of the covid-19 shock, they are milder than some projections. 12 the sbu first went to field in october 2014, but the early monthly samples were small and our formulation of the look-ahead questions did not stabilize until september 2016. 9 one possibility is that sbu firms expect a very large near-term hit from the pandemic and lockdown in 2020 and a substantial, but partial recovery by april 2021. to investigate that possibility, we turn to a special question fielded as part of the april 2020 sbu. the question reads as follows: 201cwhat is your best guess for the impact of coronavirus developments on your firm's sales revenue in 2020? the response options are a respondent-supplied percentage amount, up or down, and no effect. the results, summarized in table 2, say that firms expect the coronavirus pandemic to lower their sales by 18-19 percent in 2020. this is an enormous negative shock, and it is more than twice as large as the fall from january to april 2020 in the average one-year sales forecast. taken together, the evidence in table 2 and figure 2 says that firms in the sbu anticipate a huge negative shock to their sales in 2020 followed by a considerable but highly incomplete bounce back by april 2021. d. gross hiring and business formation in the pandemic's immediate wake the top part of table 3 presents two questions about the impact of covid-19 on staffing levels that appeared in the april 2020 sbu. one question asks about impact on own-company staffing levels since 1 march 2020, and the other asks about the anticipated impact over the next four weeks. for each question, the survey instrument allows responses in five categories: number of permanent layoffs, with no expectation of recall; number of temporary layoffs and furloughs; hires of new employees; cuts to the number of contractors and leased workers; and additions to the number of contractors and leased workers. cumulating the responses to these two questions and aggregating over firms yields a near-term net contraction equal to 11.9 percent of march 1 employment.13 92 percent of this net contraction happened between march 1 and the mid-april survey response period, and the rest is anticipated to happen over the ensuing four weeks. despite the large negative employment impact of the pandemic and lockdown over the span of two-and-one-half months, the coronavirus shock also caused gross staffing gains: new hires equal to 3.8 percent of march 1 employment, and new contractors and leased workers equal 13 bartik et al. (2020) find a 40 percent employment contraction from 31 january to late march/early april in their survey of american firms with fewer than 500 employees. the gap between their employment contraction figure and ours is partly due to their focus on small firms. as they report in their table 2, smaller firms in their sample contract more sharply in this period. we also find sharper contractions among the smallest firms in the sbu. however, the firm-size differential is too small to fully explain the discrepancy between their estimated employment contraction and ours. 10 to 0.2 percent. echoing our remarks in section ii.a, the under sampling of young firms in the sbu and the omission of new firms in our sample frame are sources of downward bias in the estimated rate of gross staffing gains. thus, we see our estimate as conservative. the survey data also say the coronavirus shock caused gross staffing reductions equal to 14.9 percent of march 1 employment, mostly due to temporary layoffs and furloughs.14 here as well, we see our estimate of the gross staffing reduction impact as conservative for two reasons: the sbu under samples younger firms, and highly stressed firms are less likely to respond to surveys. we can restate our results about gross staffing gains and losses in terms that are less sensitive to these sources of bias. in particular, table 3 implies that coronavirus-related development caused about 3 new hires for every 10 layoffs. if we include contactors and leased workers, the ratio is about 2.7 gross staffing gains for every 10 gross staffing reductions. weekly census bureau statistics on gross business formation also point to gross hiring activity in the near-term wake of the pandemic, although at a much slower pace than pre-covid. these statistics derive from administrative data on applications for a new employer identification number (ein) on irs form ss-4. figure 3 reports statistics for 201chigh-propensity201d applications, which are the subset of applications for a new ein that the census bureau regards as having a high propensity to hire paid employees. the figure makes two points. first, and not surprisingly, gross business formation rates after mid-march are down 24 to 38 percent relative to the same calendar week in the 2019. second, and perhaps surprisingly, high-propensity business applications continue at the pace of 20-30 thousand per week. in sum, new business formation is greatly depressed in the wake of the covid-19 shock, but it is not moribund. the statistical evidence in table 3 and figure 3 align well with the anecdotal evidence in section i of large pandemic-induced demand increases at certain firms, even as layoffs in the 14 we can obtain a corresponding estimate of aggregate gross staffing reductions in the private sector as follows: there were 152.5 million employees in the nonfarm private sector as of february 2020, according to the bls current employment statistics. according to bls (2017), independent contractors are 6.9 percent of employment in the current population survey. multiplying the february 2020 cps employment figure by 6.9 percent yields an estimated 10.9 million contract workers. finally, 14.9% of 163.4 (=152.5 + 10.9) million yields aggregate gross staffing reductions of 24.4 million. as we explain in the text, we see this estimate as conservative. 11 u.s. economy exceeded twenty million. at the risk of belaboring the obvious, it's also worth remarking on an important distinction between the evidence in table 3 and figure 3, on the one hand, and the evidence in figures 1 and 2 on the other. table 3 speaks to the near-term reallocative impact of the covid-19 shock, and figure 3 provides evidence that job-creating business formation continues in the face of the pandemic and lockdown. in contrast, figures 1 and 2 provide evidence that the shock is expected to trigger unusually large rates of job and sales reallocation across firms over the next year. thus, our evidence speaks to both near-term and medium-term reallocative effects of the covid-19 shock. e. dispersion in equity returns across firms tables 1-3 and figures 1-3 draw on data sources with short histories. that makes it hard to situate the evidence in a broad historical context. thus, we turn now to time-series evidence on the dispersion of returns across common equity securities for u.s.-listed firms.15 specifically, we compute the interquartile range and the standard deviation of the value-weighted return distribution using closing market prices from the end of one month to the end of the next. we consider return dispersion rather than the excess reallocation of equity value given the predominant role of discount rate variation in aggr"

via platform-based strategies. introduction: the age of platforms is here the fourth industrial revolution is well underway, with smart manufacturing, 3d printing, and other technologies driving fundamental market shifts and waves of digital-driven disruption. many companies are seeing value being created and captured in novel ways, moving away from legacy products as standalone offers and toward the data and insights products and solutions generators. as this iot-powered world matures, b2b enterprises must rethink their products and services to thrive in an industry 4.0 environment2014or risk being left behind by more nimble, digital-native competitors. in industries from advertising to manufacturing to enterprise software, value increasingly lies within data and information flows. over the past year, our digital industrial transformation series has aimed to help organizations navigate this shift.1 in the series's first article,2 we discussed how companies can capitalize on an industry 4.0 environment by embedding new digital technologies and once a novel idea, digital platforms have become increasingly common. at the most basic level, platforms help to make resources and participants more accessible to each other on an as-needed basis. platforms are typically created and owned by a single entity2014an orchestrator2014that works to assemble a mix of

participation. when designed correctly, platforms can become powerful catalysts for rich ecosystems of resources and participants. what occurs in these ecosystems varies depending on the nature of the platform and which players it convenes. deloitte has categorized platforms into four categories (figure 1) that represent how an organization can create value for itself and participants.32digital

that said, not every organization has a clear path to becoming a network orchestrator; many entities might be best suited to simply participate in one or more platform ecosystems. in evaluating whether to proceed with a platform-based strategy, leaders should begin by considering the following questions:2022 does our business align with a platform-based business model?can we occupy major influence points on the platform to connect disparate parties?2022 can we develop a trust-based relationship with other partners on the platform?2022 do we have the capabilities to build and sustain a

decisive decisions.preparing for platform transformation: a fundamental shift in business, culture, and mind set for new platform entrants, a common error is to underestimate just how difficult it is to monetize your existing offerings, data, or capabilities in a new way. building a platform demands an enterprise-level transformation; it requires new, digital ways of doing business and all that comes with them, including major adjustments in your people, your processes, and your technology at deloitte, we approach these issues through the context of the digital industrial transformation framework, which acts as a guide for organizations embarking on large-scale digital transformation. launching a digital platform, for example, will require revisiting each of these five elements, starting with strategy formulation. from there, strategic choices carry through to business model redesign, development of necessary capabilities, creation of an operating model, and finally, acquisition of necessary people, process, and technologies. figure 3 illustrates the interplay between these decisions and how, together, they create the basis for digital transformation. 5platform

into steps one and two developing your strategy and business model and provide useful tools that you and your team can leverage as you begin your platform journey.define the platform vision: what value and for whom?the first step in developing a platform strategy is to develop a compelling vision. just as an organization might articulate a vision for a new business unit or product line, platform entrants should develop a compelling vision that articulates the goals and aspirations for its platform-based deloitte insights. in this series's second article, setting the north star, we discuss critical success factors for a vision,6 including how a vision should be a clear, simply articulated message that ensures all stakeholders can understand the aspiration and intended outcomes. it should be mobilizing, clarifying employees purpose and keeping them engaged. it should foster alignment, allowing each function to begin to drive toward digital transformation goals. and it should excite customers and partners, signaling that the organization is positioning for the future in a way that can complement their industry 4.0 aspirations.it can be helpful to distill your vision into a single vision statement, which outlines this long-term end 6digital platform as a growth lever subscription model or something more consumption-based? the sum total of these decisions is the composition of a strategy, which is nothing more than a set of choices on where (and where not) to focus. deloitte's business model framework, introduced earlier in this series, can help guide an organization in navigating these distinct yet interrelated choices. figure 4 outlines three questions that collectively represent all the major elements of a successful platform strategy. what will you sell? what portions of the digital solution stack will you offer? will you target original equipment manufacturers (oems) or owners/operators?2022 how will you sell? on which ecosystem partners will you rely to sell through and sell with? are there new ecosystems you need to forge, and new partners to recruit?2022 how will you get paid? will you charge a subscription, or charge based on consumption or outcome?state for the platform and communicates its purpose to employees and other internal stakeholders. put simply, your vision should answer three questions:2022 what value is exchanged? outlines what the 201ccurrency201d of your platform is, which could include some combination of information, data, or goods and services.2022 who is involved? outlines the participants in your platform, which will include some combination of producers (internal/external), consumers, and other stakeholders. 2022 how does it work? outlines the respective tools and functionalities that bring stakeholders in, facilitate sharing, and match participants, etc., in your platform.a vision statement could follow, for instance, the construct platform name is a category platform that helps core participants to facilitate essential exchanges through key functions.of course, while the vision statement is a useful tool for galvanizing internal support and alignment, it is only a starting point. the vision statement is meant to be directional and can be refined over time. this statement can help us make choices about how to bring this vision to life. indeed, you and your team have an infinite set of permutations and combinations of strategies at your disposal. will you cater to small and medium-sized businesses or large enterprises? where in the customer's buying process should you invest most heavily? will you aim to monetize via a platform strategy can help companies transition from a 201cmake one, sell one model to become network orchestrators figure business model choices as winning moves winning moves are defined as business model choices on a spectrum along the following dimensions, each with associated trade-offs.customer type what are we selling?solution archetype how do we sell?route to market how do we get paid?monetization guiding questions will you sell solutions to owners/operators to reduce costs, to oems to help them enhance their own products and grow revenue, or to both?trade-off considerations owners/operators may see more direct and quantifiable benefits in the short term, though poems may see long-term benefits from increased value capture.will you primarily offer discrete products, configurable bundles, or integrated solutions? will you offer services to help deliver and implement your solutions?what will be your channel mix between direct, sell-with,and sell-through?will you offer perpetual licenses, a subscription model, a usage-based model, an outcome-based model, or some mixture of these options?discrete products provide customers with maximum flexibility and may accelerate near-term revenue potential, whereas integrated solutions build brand and may lead to higher long-term revenue potential.selling direct to customers provides a higher degree of control butmay limit reach.perpetual license and subscription models are easier to manage and provide more predictable cash flows, but outcome-based models increase collaboration between solution providers and customers.customer type: to whom will you sell your solution? what needs will you address?the first and most important decision is determining which customers your platform will serve. this includes developing a robust understanding of both the users who will use your platform as part of the natural flow of their work/life and the leaders who may make the enterprise wide decision to migrate a current process to your platform. but how to identify a set of users to target? this depends largely on what pain points your platform is aiming to address. although you could endeavor to build a platform that aims to mitigate every unmet need, it is imperative to identify the two or three pain points that are both compelling enough to support a digital business and something your organization has a right to solve. if the unmet needs addressed do not markedly improve customers' status quo, or you don't have a viable path to address them, then the platform will be unsuccessful. if done correctly, the upside is limitless. this process requires a deep understanding of unmet needs along the customer journey2014from awareness to purchase to after-sales support. granted, identifying where opportunities lie can be difficult, and sometimes the thorniest issues are 8digital platform as a growth lever hidden in plain sight. consider the amazon experience as an example. as the company rapidly scaled its e-commerce business, amazon and its partners found themselves building the same technical infrastructure, over and over again.8 the process was duplicative, repetitive, and costly. what if amazon could build an internal business unit dedicated to the development of out-of-the-box infrastructure solutions, for use in its rapidly growing e-commerce verticals? it was from this seemingly mundane observation that the amazon web services (aws) platform was born. simply by addressing its own issue, aws was able to unlock a massive universe of customers facing the same challenges.solution archetype: what are the platform offerings and supporting capabilities? the second decision involves platform offerings2014the actual products or services that your platform will make available to target customers. of course, the decisions made here should be anchored in your understanding of the platform's target customers.consider salesforce, whose marketplace platform brings together businesses of all kinds, independent developers, and implementation consultants in addition to the company's own relationship managers and product developers. in its early days, when the platform was in startup mode, salesforce targeted small and medium-size businesses that could benefit from the simplification of it functions that salesforce was seeking to create. it was this focus that at least in part led to the creation of the salesforce app exchange, a crowdsourcing marketplace for customer relationship management (crm) solutions known for its ease of use and accessibility, for even small customers.9 more recently, salesforce has launched what it calls 201csalesforce essentials,201d optimized for small businesses.10route to market: how do we sell?having identified target customer type and offering set, the next decision focuses on the route to market, or how to sell. implicit in the decisions made here are choices about whether to build capabilities, buy capabilities, or partner with a third party in order to deliver the desired experience. after taking stock of a company's internal capabilities, it may become clear that partnerships are necessary to execute the desired customer experience. partnerships can often be an ideal course of action if the need for differentiation or strategic control over that capability is low. if rapid speed to market is required or if market uncertainty is high, partnerships can be a lower-risk way of testing a new market. for example, aws partners with consulting firms to sell and implement aws solutions, as this offers aws greater market penetration while helping partners differentiate their business offerings to clients.11 for more information on the decision to build, buy, or partner, see our article on strategic alliances, ecosystem-driven portfolio strategy.12 partnerships can often be an ideal course of action if the need for differentiation or strategic control over that capability is low.also implicit in this step is the identification of your platform delivery mechanism. this involves a deep understanding of how customers and partners would prefer to interact with your product and service offerings and is key to enabling an efficient customer experience. do customers value the asset-light, cost-effective approach that a cloud-based solution might provide? or would they 9platform strategy can help companies transition from a 201cmake one, sell one201d model to become network orchestrators prefer a licensed, on-premise solution that might better accommodate customers who prioritize data security and privacy? salesforce's customers, for example, place a premium on scalability, which makes the company's out-of-the-box, cloud-based solution a natural fit.13 similarly, amazon provides modular, cloud-based physical storage and distribution capabilities to vendors while offering users a seamless online experience.14monetization model: how do we get paid?finally, monetization is an important consideration to ensure the sustainability of the platform. organizations should first determine the offer structure (free or fee-based). if fee-based, there are other options to consider, including fixed-/pre-paid, subscription (unlimited), subscription (predefined), freemium, consumption-based, and outcome-based. selecting the monetization model depends on how customers intend to interact with the platform. for example, amazon's pay-as-you-go model allows customers to adapt to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets or missing capacity.15 similarly, salesforce works on a subscription (predefined) model and charges a fee based on tiers of usage and functionalities for users.16 monetization strategy will be important as you start to communicate the platform vision with internal stakeholders and begin to validate the idea with customers and partners. these decisions, taken together, form the initial basis for your organization's entry into a platform business. note that these decisions can2014and probably should2014change as the platform evolves. business blueprints can serve as powerful tools if they include flexibility for your business model to change and evolve as you receive feedback from customers. for example, amazon's initial business model began as an online bookstore but left enough flexibility to reinvent the company several times over2014first to a general e-commerce platform and then to a data warehousing solution.17identify assumptions and uncertainties ahead: why might we be wrong?building this business blueprint is like a grand experiment for your company. as with a scientific experiment, your blueprint should be anchored in hypotheses about your platform business model, informed by high-level market analysis and an understanding of your company's capabilities. inherent in this preliminary understanding of your platform are assumptions and beliefs about how your platform might drive value and about the ecosystem of partners and users it will convene. our success depends on pressure-testing these hypotheses and, in so doing, understanding exactly what we know and what we don2019t know about the potential of this idea. essentially, we want to identify our blind spots by asking, 201cwhy might we be wrong?201dso how do we test these blind spots? at deloitte, we use a balanced breakthrough model, a framework that tests feasibility, viability, and desirability to identify where weak points might exist in a vision and corresponding blueprint.desirability: do customers and/or partners need the platform? this question aims to understand the motivations and core beliefs of our customers and partners. every successful platform innovation has been fundamentally human-centered. as such, we must ask ourselves pointed questions about whether the platform vision and blueprint choices resonate with the people whose unmet needs we seek to address. questions to ask about your vision and blueprint include:2022 will customers change their behavior to use the platform?2022 do platform capabilities (as imagined) address users2019 unmet needs in a compelling way?10 digital platform as a growth lever2022 is there sufficient incentive for partners to join the ecosystem created by our platform?(mvp), and other techniques, to pressure-test your platform concept.feasibility: can the platform be developed? a new platform can be extremely valuable and can certainly provide the basis for an improved customer experience, but a desirable idea is not enough. your platform vision and blueprint must be feasible and implementable. questions to ask here include:2022 do we have the capabilities to develop the platform as we have imagined it?2022 do we have the appropriate in-house talent to make this happen?2022 can we accelerate platform commercialization by connecting it with more mature ecosystems?viability: is there value for our enterprise? is the opportunity significant enough? this factor speaks to financial opportunity. questions to ask about your vision and blueprint include:the path to commercialization: developing an mvp just as scientists might use controlled experiments to test assumptions about the world around them in an iterative, data-driven way, you and your team will need controlled experiments to test assumptions about the platform. in our case, these 201cexperiments201d are known as iterations of mvp, a version of a new platform that includes only the most essential elements2014such as a barely working prototype2014to test how target customers will react to your platform. an mvp should meet the following requirements: 2022 build our initial set of capabilities within a predetermined time frame to validate our thinking with customers/partners2022 allow for flexibility to scale offerings from the mvp2022 can we effectively monetize the offerings in our platform?2022 will users be willing to pay?2022 test our most critical uncertainties2014for example, does the platform offer capabilities that address customers2019 unmet needs in a compelling way?2022 can we create a competitive position with this platform given the current (and future) market landscape?thinking through these questions of desirability, feasibility, and viability can help refine your platform concept, strengthen your business blueprint, and identify (and mitigate) blind spots that could jeopardize your platform in the future. that said, simply cataloging these issues can only be so helpful. at a certain point, you and your team will need to get out into the field and rigorously test these hypotheses. in the next section, we2019ll discuss how you can use a minimum viable platform for the most ambitious leaders, it can be difficult to purposely constrain the scope of your efforts. in a world where tech giants are transforming industries and reaching billions of users through expansive network effects and multiside marketplaces, it may be difficult to take a step back from your grand vision and settle for a more limited, preliminary iteration. it should be noted, though, that many of the most significant platform-based companies2014those now shaping our world2014started with humble prototypes in the beginning. amazon, for example, which now touches nearly every industry with a variety of software, hardware, and commerce offerings, 11platform strategy can help companies transition from a 201cmake one, sell one201d model to become network orchestrators started by selling books, with an mvp that jeff bezos thought could effectively test his vision.18the common thread among all these mvp efforts: leaders invested in developing just enough of the platform so that a small set of customers could react to something. even these massive platform-based companies began with what were essentially wire-frame models that they presented to customers and asked, 201cwhat do you think?201d indeed, customer feedback (and mechanisms to collect it) will be key to understanding how your platform vision and blueprint choices resonate with customers. this feedback will help you to tweak functionality, adjust the value created, and even make go versus no-go decisions down the road. right track, you can introduce subsequent mvps that will be tested through iterative, agile sprints. navigating this process, as figure 5 illustrates, will feature a concurrent push and pull of developing functionality on the one hand and testing with customers on the other.the common thread among these mvp efforts: leaders invested in developing just enough of the platform so that a small set of customers could react to something. these activities will not occur without concerted investment and resources, and you and your team will need to take a series of actions to ensure this process has what it needs to succeed. first, you2019ll need a strong execution team. tap dynamic individuals who can both manage the present and envision the future simultaneously. second, you2019ll need a robust governance model complete with well-defined roles, a transparent decision-making process, and progress tracking at the initiative- and the initial mvp is only the first step in a larger effort. as you receive confirmation from the market that your platform business blueprint is on the 12digital platform as a growth lever.10. prepare for next release

making significant progress in the development of the platform, and yet still 201cfail201d under traditional performance metrics, such as profitability. for more information on developing an operating model, see our article architecting an operating model: a platform for accelerating digital transformation.19conclusion while these initial steps in developing your platform business are important milestones, they collectively represent the beginning of a longer transformation journey. a journey that begins with the initial mvp is winding and will require patience and vision.salesforce's journey is a case in point. it took the crm giant roughly 10 years an entire decade before it grossed us$1 billion in annual revenues.20 those 10 years also hold the key to the company's success. when the dotcom bubble burst in 2001, wiping out many of its clients, salesforce stayed the course and doubled down on leaders' vision of being a world-class internet company for sales force automation and continued with an aggressive marketing strategy themed around end of software.21 over the next several years, as new as-a-service companies arrived in the market, salesforce continued to expand its ecosystem and capabilities through offerings such as app exchange and idea exchange, offering third-party developers a platform to build and sell custom applications on top of salesforce, and inviting customers to contribute new feature ideas for future releases.22 we believe,says chief innovation officer simon mulcahy, that our digital platform offerings are powerful enablers of customer-centric transformations and a value multiplier for everyone in the salesforce ecosystem"
3rd-Party - Drivers of Pandemic Economic Decline (Jun-20).pdf,A great example on how mobile phone location data can be used to answer some fundamental questions on peoples behavior during the Covid-19 crisis. Cellular phone data was used to examine customer visits to more than 2.25 million US businesses across 110 different industries. The authors argue that the enormous reduction in economic activity is driven mainly by individuals voluntary decisions to disengage from commerce rather than government-imposed restrictions.,"lockdown, and diversion: comparing drivers of pandemic economic decline. preliminary abstract the collapse of economic activity in 2020 from covid-19 has been immense. an important question is how much of that collapse resulted from government-imposed restrictions on activity versus people voluntarily choosing to stay home to avoid infection. this paper examines the drivers of the economic slowdown using cellular phone records data on customer visits to more than 2.25 million individual businesses across 110 different industries. comparing consumer behavior over the crisis within the same commuting zones but across state and county boundaries with different policy regimes suggests that legal shutdown orders account for only a modest share of the massive changes to consumer behavior (and that tracking county-level policy conditions is significantly more accurate than using state-level policies alone). while overall consumer traffic fell by 60 percentage points, legal restrictions explain only 7 percentage points of this. individual choices were far more important and seem tied to fears of infection. traffic started dropping before the legal orders were in place; was highly influenced by the number of covid deaths reported in the county; and showed a clear shift by consumers away from busier, more crowded stores toward smaller, less busy stores in the same industry. states that repealed their shutdown orders saw symmetric, modest recoveries in activity, further supporting the small estimated effect of policy. although the shutdown orders had little aggregate impact, they did have a significant effect in reallocating consumer activity away from 201cnonessential201d to 201cessential201d businesses and from restaurants and bars toward groceries and other food sellers. the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus and its associated covid-19 disease has had unprecedented effects on economic activity around the world. in an effort to limit the spread of the disease, many governments adopted stay-at-home/shelter-in-place orders. that ignited a debate over cre-opening and whether the health benefits from their slowing of the virus outweighs the economic damage they did. it is not clear, however, that the economic decline actually came from the lockdown orders. by many accounts, anxious individuals engaged in physical distancing on their own accord. understanding the size of that effect is critical policy question. if fear rather than policy drives the economics, the economic stimulus from repealing the orders may be considerably smaller than some might predict. in this paper, we estimate the causal effect of government policy on the economy during the initial spread of covid-19 in the u.s. using data on foot traffic at 2.25 million individual businesses. our empirical strategy separates the effects of voluntary distancing from that of policy orders by comparing differences in foot traffic across businesses within commuting zones that span jurisdictions facing differing legal restrictions. this leverages two related types of variation: businesses in border-spanning commuting zones where jurisdictions impose of shelter-in-place orders at different times (e.g., northern illinois when illinois placed a sheltering order on march 20th while wisconsin waited until the following week), and businesses in commuting zones where a jurisdiction never imposed an order (e.g., the quad cities area, where the illinois towns of moline and rock island faced stay-at-home orders but bordering davenport and bettendorf, iowa did not). we collect data on the shutdown policy conditions at the county level, rather than relying on state-level laws as in most of the existing literature, because many of the hardest hit counties in the country imposed shutdown orders earlier than their states did. 1 the results indicate that legal shutdown orders account for a modest share of the massive overall changes in consumer behavior. total foot traffic fell by more than 60 percentage points, but legal restrictions explain only around 7 percentage points of that. in other words, comparing two similar establishments within a commuting zone but on opposite sides of a shelter-in-place (s-i-p) order, both saw enormous drops in customer activity. the one on the s-i-p side saw a drop that was only about one-tenth larger. the vast majority of the decline was due to consumers choosing of their own volition to avoid commercial activity. we find evidence tying this voluntary decline in commercial activity to fear of infection. the drop in consumer visits is strongly correlated with the number of local covid deaths. further, within an industry, drops in visits are disproportionately larger in establishments that were busier/larger before covid. this is consistent with greater avoidance of and substitution away from establishments with higher potential transmission contacts. interestingly, and further supporting the modest size of the estimated s-i-p effects, when some states and counties repealed their shutdown orders toward the end of our sample, the recovery in economic activity due to the repeal was equal in size to the decline at imposition. thus the recovery is limited not so much by policy per se as the reluctance of individuals to engage in economic activity that requires interacting with others. although the shutdown orders had a small aggregate impact, they had significant reallocation effect by driving consumer activity from nonessential to essential businesses and from restaurants and bars toward groceries and other food sellers. there is a rapidly burgeoning empirical economics literature examining many aspects of the covid-19 pandemic. our study is tied most closely to two areas of this literature. one involves studies using cellular phone data to track how fear of the virus or lockdown orders have affected personal mobility and interactions. examples include alexander and karger (2020), alfaro et al. 2 (2020), barrios et al. (2020), chen et al. (2020), cicala et al. (2020), couture et al. (2020), dave et al. (2020a), fang et al. (2020), gupta et al. (2020), and nguyen et al. (2020). goldfarb and tucker (2020) tie personal mobility to retail activity by evaluating which retail industries have the most social interaction. maloney and taskin (2020) demonstrate connections between mobility and commercial activity in u.s. restaurants and swedish movie theaters. the second area of related work includes studies that focus directly on the economic impact of lockdown policy, though with different data. kahn et al. (2020) use job postings data to show that the labor market deteriorated substantially but did so across the board, rather than more in states with shutdown orders. rojas et al. (2020) investigate ui claims and similarly find shifts across the board. bartik et al. (2020a, 20020b) study the impact of covid on small businesses using survey data and employment/hours using the homebase data set, documenting a significant employment decline. aum et al. (2020) look at the labor market effects of covid in korea (which did not have large government imposed lockdowns) by comparing regions with larger covid outbreaks to ones with smaller and find employment collapses even without policy. coibon et al. (2020) do the same with survey data in the nielsen panel so they can track aggregate spending and find that lockdowns greatly reduce spending (though their measure of lockdown is a subjective survey questions rather than an actual measure of policy). gupta et al. (2020) look at cps data and argue that 60% of the decrease in employment came from state social distancing policy, though they are unable to rule out the possibility that the employment drop began before the policies were in place. our paper differs from these studies in that we combine detailed phone record location data at the level of the business (rather than the individual) with more comprehensive data on legal restrictions than what existed in previous work. this allows us to investigate not just patterns in aggregate activity but substitution patterns across businesses as well. on the policy side, most studies 3 use state level information on s-i-p orders and legal restrictions aggregated by sites like the new york times. in reality, however, a large number of counties and cities imposed lockdown orders separately from their states and before the state acted. we demonstrate below that especially in situations involving cross-border comparisons, the local policy data are important. 1. data our data come from the safe graph panel of mobile phone usage (see safegraph, 2020 or squire, 2020, for more details). safegraph collects information on almost 45 million cellular phone users2014about 10% of devices in the u.s2014and compiles the number of visits to millions of different 201cpoints of interest201d in the u.s. as specified by address. we will use this business level information. in our sample, safe graph reported visit numbers excluding employees of the business. we focus on business locations in industries where consumer visits are a plausible measure of economic activity (not, for example, manufacturing facilities) and we drop non-profits and other non-commercial enterprises. there are some complications and measurement errors that arise for businesses that are co-located in a space like a starbucks inside an subway station, say, so that the phone data might record a large number of visits to the location but in reality, most of those were not to the business in question. our sample includes more than 2.25 million business locations and includes weekly customer visitation data from march 1 to may 16 and monthly visitation data before that. implicitly we assume that the number of visits corresponds to the amount of economic activity. if people shop half as frequently but spend twice as much each time they go out, we would not observe that behavior. the timing of the aggregate drop in consumer visits, though, matches well the broader economic declines. to combine industries into one regression and measure aggregate effects, we weight businesses in our regressions by their average number of consumer visits in january, before covid. the results are largely identical if we weight by the product of 4 january visits and the industry average revenue per visit (computed using supplemental industry revenue data from the census bureau). for policy measures, most of the literature has used state-level shutdown orders. however, many lower levels of government imposed shutdown orders prior to their parent states acting. we collected more detailed policy data that includes county-level orders and use that here. we describe these data in goolsbee et al. (2020) and will make it publicly available. 2. the problem of confounding lockdown with fear figure 1 shows the precipitous drop and partial recovery in visits to businesses in the safegraph data over march, april, and early may. it shows two series, each measured using establishments2019 logged average visits per day across the week. the red line shows the raw data. the blue line plots the values of the week fixed effects in a regression of logged visits on establishment and week fixed effects. this latter series reflects average patterns over time controlling for any changes in the composition of establishments in the sample. we normalize both series to a value of zero in the first week of march for comparison purposes. both series show similar patterns. from the start of march to the trough in the week of april 12th, the aggregate number of logged visits fell by around 0.9, a 60% decline. the suddenness of this drop is similar to that in aggregate economic measures like the weekly economic indicators of lewis et al. (2020) or the ui claims data. in the appendix table, we break down the start-to-trough drop in visits for the 110 6-digit naics industries in our sample. it shows mostly expected patterns in terms of severity of the downturn. businesses in almost all industries saw large declines in foot traffic, but they range from a 99% decline in the hardest hit industry, theaters and dinner theaters, to slight increase at outdoor power equipment stores at the other extreme. 5 the question of how much of this collapse came from government regulations is not immediately obvious in the figure. a simple time series correlation would suggest the two are related, but if the spread of the virus both made people afraid to go out and induced states and counties to impose lockdowns, the correlation could be spurious. indeed, most jurisdictions did not impose legal shutdown orders until late march or early april, but figure 1 shows a considerable collapse of commerce before most shutdown orders were in place. the basic problem of with estimating the impact of policy becomes clear in table 1. here we again combine all businesses together into a single regression, weighting each by their visits in january. the dependent variable is the establishment's log average number of visits in the week. the key explanatory variable is an indicator for the existence of a shelter-in-place (s-i-p) order for the establishment's county in that week. the regression also includes establishment fixed effects. we cluster the standard errors at the county level. this regression suggests a massive effect of s-i-p orders on economic activity. the coefficient in column (1) indicates s-i-p orders correspond to a more than 70 log point decline in consumer visits. in column (2) we include both our county-level policy measure as well as an indicator for the applicable state-level policy. the results indicate that the locally detailed measure explains far more of the change in economic activity than the state-level measure, supporting our more geographically detailed metrics. column (3) adds to the regression the cumulative number of covid deaths in the county. because the death count distribution is highly skewed while still having many county-weeks with zero cases, we use the logarithmic-like inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (see burbridge, magee and robb, 1988). as is apparent in the table, local deaths are strongly related to the size of the reduction in consumer visits. further, controlling for deaths both reduces the estimated impact of 6 county s-i-p policy by 25%. column (3) also thoroughly documents the importance of the county level data instead of the state. the state-level policy coefficient is economically small, statistically insignificant and of the wrong sign. we will use only the more detailed measure for the remaining results. finally, in column (4), we add commuting-zone-by-week fixed effects. these fixed effects control for any unobserved factors, like consumers2019 average current fears of infection, that operate across the geographic area in that week. it also means that the estimated effect of s-i-p orders in this specification comes from comparing differences in consumer behavior within commuting zones but across counties with different policies. here, the estimated impact of shutdown orders falls by an order of magnitude relative to that column (1), to a bit over 7%. the comparison of the coefficient on the s-i-p order indicator in column (4) to those in the table's other columns is important. it shows the correlation between the decline in economic activity and s-i-p policies arose mostly because the covid crisis jointly drove both, not because s-i-ps had a large causal effect on activity. people greatly reduced their activity regardless of the existence of s-i-p orders. the orders per se cut activity further in areas subject to them, but by only a modest amount, around one-tenth of the total response. the results in column (4) also demonstrate that even as the estimated impact of lockdown policy is modest, local covid deaths still significantly drive down consumer visits. the spread of the disease itself is strongly correlated with declines in economic activity. because the regression includes commuting zone-week fixed effects, this indicates that even within commuting zones, more local deaths reduce local economic activity. interestingly, though, applying this within commuting-zone coefficient at face value as an aggregate impact and multiplying by the overall increase in deaths over our entire sample, the rise in covid deaths would correspond to a decrease in economic activity of around 30% or half the total decline observed in the data. 7 3. robust identification: the modest impact of lockdowns estimated multiple ways because there are two types of variation in the data2014businesses in places where the lockdowns occurred earlier on one side of a border than the other, and businesses in places where one side of the border is in one of the eight states that never had a general lockdown.we can test whether the estimated impact of lockdown orders is consistent across these sources of variation. the results are in table 2. column (1) shows the estimated impact of lockdowns in the subsample of only commuting zones that share a border with a jurisdiction that never had lockdown. column (2) looks only at businesses in the other commuting zones, where identification comes strictly from timing differences in states2019 and counties' impositions of policies. the estimated impact is almost identical in the two subsamples. then, in column (3), we look at potential asymmetries in s-i-p effects depending on whether they are being imposed or repealed. by the end of our sample, some states and counties had repealed their sheltering orders or let them expire, hoping this would restart economic growth. our results above, however, suggest that repealing the s-i-p orders should not matter much as long if people still fear the spread of the virus. we examine this in more detail by allowing s-i-p repeals to have a different coefficient than s-i-p impositions. specifically, our repeal variable equals one when a jurisdiction repeals its sheltering order, so the total effect of a repeal equals the negative of the s-i-p order coefficient (i.e., as it turns from 1 to 0) plus the repeal coefficient. as seen in the table, the repeal coefficient is small, negative, and not significantly different from zero. thus the effect of repealing a s-i-p order is statistically the mirror image of imposing one, and certainly no larger. the point estimates imply economic activity fell 8% when governments instituted the orders and rose 5% when they repealed them. 8 repealing lockdowns may not a particularly powerful tool for restarting growth. if people are otherwise concerned about potential infection, lifting legal restrictions on their activity has limited effect. moreover, such a policy would have to be balanced against the fact that s-i-p orders may slow the spread of the disease2014see, e.g., baker et al. (2020), chen et al. (2020), dave et al. (2020b, 2020c), or friedson et al. (2020). if repealing lockdowns leads to a fast enough increase in covid infections and deaths and a concomitant withdrawal of consumers from the market place, they might ultimately end up harming business activity. 4. shifting: time and geography in table 3 we look for evidence of shifting/gaming of s-i-p orders. high frequency data such as ours can give a misleading picture of policy impacts if, in the week prior to the policy being put into place, people rush to engage in economic activity that would have otherwise waited until later. comparing before-and-after activity levels will overstate the effect of the policy because of this intertemporal substitution. similarly, the estimated impact of lockdowns will overstate their true effect if consumers shift their commercial activity across borders. if customers in, say, memphis, tennessee simply drove to arkansas (where there was no statewide s-i-p order) to get their hair cut when memphis was under a sheltering order, it will look like the order causes a drop in activity even though overall commercial activity did not change. we investigate intertemporal shifting in column (1) of table 3. here, we include one-week lags and leads of the policy. there is no evidence of anticipatory increases in consumer activity in the week before s-i-p enactment and there is evidence that policy effects exhibit persistence once imposed. in column (2) we measure geographic shifting using as our dependent variable safegraph data on the average distance traveled to a business among its customers that week. if the sort of 9 cross-border shifting of activity from s-i-p jurisdictions to non-s-i-p jurisdictions is occurring, we should see the average distance traveled rise substantially when s-i-p orders go into effect. we find no such pattern; the point estimate is small, statistically insignificant, and negative. these two pieces of evidence indicate that the effects of s-i-p orders, such as they are, do not seem to induce a lot of intertemporal or spatial shifting of economic activity. further, it is worth noting that to the extent that any such shifting does occur, this will result in our estimates overstating the true economic effect of s-i-p policies, meaning that even their modest size is an upper bound. 5. fear and the choice of big versus small business in this section we document differential patterns in the slowdown across stores of different sizes. people afraid of infection may avoid larger, busier stores in favor of smaller options with fewer visitors. our results indicate this is what happened, further suggesting fear of the virus is an overriding determinant of people's decisions to engage in economic activity. we divide the businesses up within their state-by-industry cell based on their size/traffic before covid arrived (we use the total number of consumer visits to the location in january). we then classify each establishment into one of three size groupings within its state-industry: smallest 20%, middle 60% and largest 20%. for instance, we rank all grocery stores in wisconsin by their traffic in january; the busiest 20% are in the top size/traffic category, and so on. we first regress the number of weekly visits to a business on establishment fixed effects and separate week fixed effects for each of the three business size quantiles. we plot these week-by-quantile fixed effects in figure 2. activity falls for all businesses, but falls dramatically more for large, high-traffic businesses than for smaller, less busy ones. at the trough, traffic is down over 70% at the largest establishments, but only about 45% at the smallest ones. consumers are 10 substituting away relatively more from industry businesses that pose a greater probability of contact with others.1 in column (1) of table 4, we measure this differential size response statistically by looking at the change in establishments2019 log daily visits from january 2020 to the trough week of april 12 as a function of the establishment's size quantile within its industry-state. relative to their industry cohorts in the middle 60% of the size distribution, small businesses had considerably more traffic at the trough (they had lost traffic on average, but considerably less than the larger businesses did). the difference is about 50 log points, or over 60%. conversely, the largest 20% of establishments saw a larger decline in traffic, about 30% more, than did the middle quantile. column (2) interacts the number of local covid deaths with the business size categories. localities where the disease is more prevalent see a more pronounced relative shift away from large businesses and toward small ones, consistent with fear of infection driving consumer behavior. column (3) shows that s-i-p policies themselves also lead to larger shifts away from the biggest establishments. 6. lockdowns and business diversion the evidence points to a modest impact of shutdown orders on aggregate economic activity however, the orders can still have a significant impact on the types of businesses that consumer visit. we see that in the size results above, but potentially even more extreme responses might be induced when shutdown orders target specific types of businesses. in this section, we use the information from goolsbee et al. (2020) on government restrictions on activity at restaurants and bars and, 1 we repeated this exercise using data from the same time period in 2019 to investigate if this might be just a seasonal effect. it did not show the same pattern. we also examined whether survivor bias might make it only seem that small businesses do better, because small firms that die do not get counted. imputing zero visits for missing firms and using the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation for visits yielded the same basic patterns as in figure 2, however. 11 separately, restrictions of non-essential businesses (and which industries the policies classified as non-essential).2 the results show substantial reallocations across types of businesses. table 5 interacts these policy measures with indicators for the type of business. the results indicate that, indeed, even though general s-i-p orders reduced consumer visits by only around 5%, orders limiting the activities of defined 201cnon-essential201d business reduce visits to those establishments by a massive amount while at the same time increasing activity by roughly the same magnitude at 201cessential201d business. similarly, restaurant and bar restrictions reduced consumer visits to bars and restaurants by almost 30%, but they increased visits to non-restaurant food and beverage stores by 27%, and visits to all other businesses slightly. 7. conclusion the covid-19 crisis led to an enormous reduction in economic activity. we estimate that the vast majority of this drop is due to individuals2019 voluntary decisions to disengage from commerce rather than government-imposed restrictions on activity. several patterns in the data are consistent with these decisions reflecting people's concerns that commerce may expose them to the disease. we do not find evidence of large temporal or spatial shifting in response to shelter-in-place policies. while their aggregate effect is modest, restrictions on activity that target particular types of businesses do induce large reallocations of activity away from disallowed businesses and toward 201callowed201d ones. our results come with caveats. while we do have data on 110 industry groupings' mostly retail, personal services, restaurants and bars, and recreational industries2014where customer foot traffic is a reasonable proxy for economic activity, we do not measure policies2019 effects on activity in 2 we were not able to find essential business definitions systematically at the county level, so we are relying on the state definitions even in the counties that acted before their states. 12 other sectors. moreover, we cannot measure the dollar volume of transactions per visit, though if we weight by the average of such volume in the pre-covid period, our results remain.

3rd-Party - Economic Outlook from BoE Chief Economist (Jun-20).pdf,"The Bank of Englands Chief Economist provides a modestly positive view on the UK economic outlook for the remainder of 2020. There is a debate about which letter of the alphabet will best describe the path of the economy () It is early days, but my reading of the evidence is so far, so V. Consumer spending is increasing faster than expected, both car and home sales have improved, which plunged during lockdown. Positive developments across other major economies are increasingly apparent, though substantial downside risks have not disappeared. Unemployment is the largest current risk to economic recovery, especially among young people.","i would like to discuss today the economic outlook in the uk in the light of the covid crisis and the way monetary policy is responding to this crisis. there is a debate about which letter of the alphabet will best describe the path of the economy, with some scepticism about the v-shaped scenario path in the bank's may monetary policy report (mpr). it is early days, but my reading of the evidence is so far, so v. covid-19 is, first and foremost, a global public health crisis. the measures put in place to contain the spread of this terrible disease have been necessary, but have had severe economic and financial consequences. as a result, most countries around the world are facing a twin crisis of public and economic health. the economy in the period ahead will continue to be shaped by the virus and policy responses to it. the economy will also, though, be shaped by the behavioural responses of households and businesses, and the policy responses of governments and central banks, to these shocks. understanding those responses is the purpose of my comments today. i will partition my assessment of the economic impact of the covid crisis into four phases, or 201cquarters201d, covering the past, present and near and distant future. the first 201cquarter201d covers the initial impact of the virus; the second, the immediate recovery following these shocks; the third, the second-round effects on spending and employment; and the fourth, the longer-run impact on households and businesses. both the uk and the global economies are already well into the 201csecond quarter201d 2013 the recovery phase. the uk's recovery is more than two months old, while the global economy is perhaps three months into its recovery, in both cases from an exceptionally low starting point. let me say a little about each of the phases, before concluding on the role of policy in supporting the economy during the covid crisis. 201cthe first quarter201d the covid-19 crisis has dramatically affected public health in every country in the world. there have been over 9 million reported cases of covid globally and over half a million reported deaths, around 0.01% of the global population.1 as a point of comparison, the spanish flu of 1918 recorded 33 million deaths or close to 2% of the global population back then.2 during the first few months of the year, and unlike in 1918, most countries put in place social distancing measures to contain the spread of the virus, albeit at different times and with differing degrees of stringency (chart 1). predictably 2013 indeed, intentionally 2013 these measures severely curtailed movement of goods, services and peoples, constricting economic activity across a very wide range of sectors and countries. 1 data from european centre for disease prevention and control. 2 estimates of the death toll are uncertain. as official data have come on stream, the speed and severity of that contraction during the early months of the year has become clear. in fact this was apparent in close to real time, courtesy of a range of unofficial fast indicators of activity and employment tracked by the bank and others. the covid crisis has seen an explosion of interest internationally in developing fast indicators to track the economy in a timely fashion.3 the fast indicators used by the bank have included data on payments and credit card transactions; google searches of key economic and financial terms; measures of traffic flow, including around ports; measures of footfall on the high street; mobility and transport use metrics; bespoke surveys of households and businesses; and measures of energy demand. in some cases, such as payments data, these indicators can be mapped into the different components of consumption. for example, table 1 shows the peak-to-trough fall in a proxy for social consumption spending in pubs, restaurants, cinemas etc  based on google searches across a range of countries. this is one of the categories of spending likely to have been hit hardest by social distancing measures. it suggests peak-to-trough falls of 50-90% in social spending, across a wide range of countries, in the early months of the year. fast indicators for the uk point to a similarly precipitous fall over the same period. table 2 looks at the peak-to-trough falls in household spending using chaps payments data. 4 chaps is a sterling same-day payment system that is used to settle high-value wholesale payments as well as time-critical, lower-value payments like buying or paying a deposit on a property. further detail on how these data can be used to track the economy can be found below in chart 8.50% and 80% for all spending other than on staples (such as food and rent). social spending fell as much as 80% while delayable spending, which includes clothing, household goods and cars, fell by around 50%.  gdp data so far broadly corroborates the message from these fast indicators. compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, uk gdp fell by around 25% during the first four months of this year. the fall in uk-weighted world gdp is likely to have been similarly unprecedented. unsurprisingly, these would be the sharpest four-month falls in gdp on record, in both the uk and globally. this contraction has affected almost every sector, if to differing degrees (chart 2). the largest falls have been in the accommodation and dining sectors (over 90%). but sectors such as arts and recreation, construction and education have fallen by more than 40%. utilities, food production and real estate have been among the least affected. generally speaking, the greater a sector's reliance on personal contact, the larger its fall. this sharp contraction in economic activity has been accompanied, unsurprisingly, by a sharp fall in working hours. globally, it is estimated that hours worked in q2 were almost 11% lower than prior to the crisis, equivalent to over 300 million full-time workers.5 the imf forecast that the advanced economy unemployment rate will double this year to over 8%. and the ilo estimate that the crisis could increase unemployment globally by anywhere between 5.3 and 24.7 million people.6 in the uk, employment data to april from the labour force survey (lfs) does not point to a sharp contraction so far. but other, more timely, labour market indicators suggest a sharp fall in employment. claims for universal credit have risen by 200bd million since mid-march and administrative data from hmrc point to a large rise in joblessness. claimant count measures of unemployment have risen by around 100bd million since the start of the year. in addition, over 9 million jobs are estimated to have been furloughed as part of the government's job retention scheme.7 a further more than 2.5 million self-employed workers are claiming income support. and perhaps as many as 8 million employees are working fewer hours for a variety of reasons.8 taken together, this means that perhaps as much as half the uk workforce is currently either unemployed or underemployed. this, too, has no historical precedent.  7 the total number of jobs furloughed may not equate to the number of employees still under furlough. for example, some workers may have more than one job. and some jobs may only have been furloughed temporarily. 8 may mpr: those that remain in work may be working fewer hours than normal. this could be because of reduced demand for their services, in which case they will have spare capacity. but they may also work fewer hours because they fall ill, are required to self-isolate, or have extra non-work responsibilities, such as caring for relatives or home-schooling children. the ipsos mori survey in the may mpr suggested around 25% of employees are working fewer hours. all speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 in its may monetary policy report (mpr), the mpc produced an illustrative but plausible scenario for the uk and global economies. in this scenario, uk-weighted global gdp was expected to contract by 26% between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 and by 13% over the course of 2020. for the uk, the equivalent numbers were a peak-to-trough contraction of 27% and an annual contraction of 14%. charts 3 and 4 plot the distribution of quarterly (since 1955) and annual (since 1700) gdp growth rates in the uk, with the bank's may mpr scenario highlighted. by any conceivable metric, the covid crisis has generated an extraordinary left-tail shock to the economy, with few if any historical precedents. chart 3: distribution of quarterly gdp growth since 1955 number of observations chart 4: distribution of annual gdp growth since 1700 number of observations.the second quarter the same fast indicators used to track the collapse in activity in the first part of this year can also be used to track its recovery. generally speaking, these indicators suggest the recovery in both the uk and global economies has come somewhat sooner, and has been materially faster, than in the mpc's may mpr scenario 2013 indeed, sooner and faster than any other mainstream macroeconomic forecaster. globally, fast indicators point towards the trough in activity in the uk's main trading partners having come during, or just after the end of, the first three months of the year: in china in february and in the us and euro area in early april. that means uk-weighted global gdp has perhaps been recovering for around three months. chart 5 plots pmis for a range of the uk's major trading partners. although the pmis are a less good guide than usual to gdp outturns, they have bounced back sharply, as have some other business surveys. chart 6a plots the google-based proxy for social spending in a range of countries since the start of the year, most likely the slowest of the consumption categories to recover. this measure troughed in q1 for most countries and has since recovered across the board, albeit to different degrees. for some countries, it is already close to pre-covid levels. the country divergence is even larger in chart 6b, showing restaurant bookings across countries, but the extent of the recovery is nonetheless similar. 9 the may mpr noted that 201cthese surveys record net balances of respondents, so they provide an indication of how widespread falls in output and expectations are, but are less informative about the magnitude of the falls. so, at a time when the contractions are likely to be very large, it is difficult to use these data to predict the size of the change in output. in the light of this news, bank staff's nowcasts for world gdp growth in q2 have been revised up, by 13 percentage points to around -10%. even relative to the scale of the fall, this is a large upward revision. one reason is because social distancing measures have been loosened more rapidly than expected (chart 1), as we would expect the stringency of lockdown to affect gdp. we can use a model to explain gdp across a range of countries using the stringency of their lockdowns in that quarter, as well as a range of other country-specific factors (chart 7).10 that model suggests world gdp will be 15% lower in q2 than at the turn of the year, compared to 26% in the may mpr scenario. 10 for a panel of 55 countries, we employ a forecast combination analysis of around 20 different regression models, each of which uses different sets of explanatory variables and the final forecast is a root mean square error weighted average of forecasts from all our specifications. the variables we use are containment, economic and health policy response indices, which are calculated in-house using the oxford university covid monitoring database, apple mobility trends and country characteristics, e.g. share of exports in gdp, dummies for income level and geographic region and average gdp growth between 2014 and 2018. we also include containment policy characteristics such as the maximum containment policy response and the time spent at this maximum response in a quarter. for the uk the picture is broadly similar. fast indicators suggest the trough in activity was reached in the middle of april, with a steady recovery thereafter. chart 8 plots payments-based fast indicators for the uk mapped into four convenient categories of consumer spending. by late-june, these spending components had recovered at least a third, and in some cases all, of their prior fall. they have risen both sooner and materially faster than in the may mpr scenario. notes: based on the chaps payments that a sample of around 90 uk companies receive from their merchant acquirers on a daily basis. these payments reflect the sales that companies make through debit and credit card purchases, which are summed to estimate rolling seven-day revenues. definitions of the different consumption groups are discussed in the may mpr. among the negatively-affected components of spending social, work-related and delayable the fastest recovery has been in delayable expenditure such as diy and household goods.11 there has also been a sharp up-tick in the car and housing markets, albeit from stagnant levels. some elements of consumer confidence have bounced back too, in particular consumers appetite for major purchases. official data on retail sales have confirmed this recovery in spending, rising 12% in may to leave spending 13% below its pre-covid level. in part this may reflect the partial opening-up of a larger number of shops. but a larger part appears to have reflected a shift towards online purchases. as a fraction of total retail spending, online sales has risen from around a fifth prior to the covid crisis to around a third now. reflecting these trends, many business surveys have also bounced back from their april lows. uk pmis for may and june rose back to levels only a little below the 50 (no change) mark (chart 9), as in our major trading partners, although the precise signal to take from these balances at present is unclear. 11 the may mpr discusses what these different categories of household spending represent.  the uk's faster recovery might simply reflect an earlier relaxation of lockdown than was assumed in may, as in other countries. but there is less evidence to support that hypothesis in the uk, with the pace of relaxation broadly in line with the may mpr scenario (chart 10a). on the face of it, this suggests some greater than expected degree of underlying strength in consumer spending in the uk economy.  taking this evidence together, bank staff now expect consumer spending to be around 20% lower in q2, relative to nearly 30% in the mpr scenario. by the end of q2, spending is likely to be around 10% lower than at the start of the year. or, put differently, consumer spending in the uk is probably already above the level projected to prevail in q3 in the may mpr scenario. some of these data cover the opening-up of non-essential retail stores on 15 june. that opening-up was quantitatively significant, representing around 13% of consumption spending and halving the share of goods and services consumers which were previously unavailable (chart 10b). initial indications from payments and footfall figures suggest this opening-up has accelerated, perhaps significantly, consumer spending. in particular, chaps data suggests spending on delayable goods has now returned to pre-covid levels (chart 8), well ahead of the corresponding may scenario profile. looking ahead, the opening of pubs, restaurants, hotels, cinemas and other hospitality outlets on 4 july will provide further impetus to spending. my own market intelligence suggests considerable pent-up demand. together, these categories represent around another 10% of consumer spending. initial reports from businesses in these sectors, including from the bank's agents, suggest advance bookings are brisk. there is less evidence on which to base an updated judgement on the other components of gdp. for net trade, the may mpr scenario suggested around a 40% peak-to-trough fall in gross export and import volumes. trade and port traffic data suggest a somewhat smaller contraction. with the world economy recovering sooner than in the uk, this implies a slightly larger boost to uk gdp growth from net trade in q2. for housing and business investment, there are even less data on which to make an assessment. the may mpr scenario suggested peak-to-trough falls of 60% and 40% respectively, based in part on results from the bank's decision maker panel (dmp). the latest results from the dmp appear broadly consistent with this. updating staff's nowcasts for these high-frequency data gives an estimated fall in q2 gdp of around 20% relative to its pre-covid peak. while this is an exceptionally weak number, that is not in itself news. the news is that it is 7 percentage points less than in the may mpr scenario. by comparison, an estimate based on the stringency-based model implies a broadly similar contraction in uk gdp in q2 of 19% (chart 7). it could be argued that, while these are large upward revisions in an absolute sense, they are still relatively modest by comparison with the falls already seen. and of course, some of this rise in spending might simply be the release of pent-up demand, which could dissipate subsequently. against that, the evidence so far suggests the recovery is not simply the bringing-forward of spending. were this higher level of spending maintained, it would put gdp on a different path than in the may mpr scenario. the cumulative loss of annual gdp in the may scenario, relative to the january mpr forecast, was around 17%. if the higher starting level of gdp were maintained, the cumulative loss of gdp would more than halve to around 8%.12 the third quarter looking to the second half of the year, what might we expect? in the may mpr, the mpc's scenario foresaw a sharp pick-up in activity, with quarterly growth rates of 12-13% in each of q3 and q4. these increases were driven, in large measure, by the assumption of a phased relaxation of lockdown measures, and accompanying policy support, between july and september. to my mind, two paths are possible in the second half of the year. one involves a negative feedback loop from higher unemployment to lower spending, the other a positive feedback loop from higher spending to lower unemployment. the first poses a downside risk to the outlook, the second an upside risk. as things stand, it is unclear which of these scenarios, or feedback loops, will prove the more potent. the negative loop has its roots in the labour market. so far, levels of employment appear to have fallen less rapidly than output. against that, the number of furloughed workers has exceeded expectations, perhaps by in excess of a million people. this is good news for household incomes in the short run, as the income loss from furlough is far lower than from unemployment. indeed, this might help explain some of the greater than expected strength in demand in q2. as the furlough scheme tapers from august, however, there is a risk this greater number of furloughed workers are not hired back by employers, adding to the unemployment pool. the may mpr scenario had unemployment rising to 9%, but assumed the risk of workers not being re-hired was small. recent survey evidence, from both households and companies, suggests this risk could be larger. for example, survey evidence of companies by the dmp suggests private sector employment could be almost 10% lower by the end of 2020, implying an unemployment path somewhat higher than in the may mpr scenario. if unemployment was to rise more than expected, it increases the risk of a negative feedback loop. joblessness, or fears of it, have historically been a key driver of household savings. higher unemployment, as well as lowering incomes, could cause households to increase precautionary savings. that higher saving would lower demand and negatively affect company revenues and employment, in a vicious cycle. john maynard keynes described this dynamic in the 1930s as the 201cparadox of thrift201d.13 a paradox because prudent decisions by households, given the risks they face, have the perverse collective consequence of increasing risks to the economy and those same individuals. these dynamics might be particularly potent at 12 cumulative loss calculated as the percentage difference in the four-quarter sum of quarterly gdp at the year 1, 2 and 3 points of the january mpr, summed together. 13 keynes (1936) described this pattern and samuelson (1948) used the term paradox of thrift because households face double jeopardy risks to their lives and their livelihoods. elsewhere, i have called this dread risk. at present, dread is double-barrelled. yet this is not the only path possible for the economy. the willingness of companies to take back furloughed workers will depend importantly on their expectations about future demand for their goods and services. the stronger those expectations, the lower the likelihood of job losses. firms will not make workers redundant if they need to rehire them, at a cost, soon afterwards. this lowers unemployment risk, raises household incomes, confidence and spending and thereby boosts firm revenues and employment, in a virtuous cycle. back in the 1950s john hicks called this dynamic a super-multiplier 2013 super because the cumulative effects are amplified when emerging from recession.15 there is survey evidence to support this dynamic. the british chambers of commerce's (bcc) weekly survey suggests firms2019 demand and employment intentions have moved upwards in lockstep since april (chart 11). indeed, employment was close to balance by mid-may. surveys of employment intentions and vacancies have also recently recovered from low levels. notes: chart shows bcc quarterly survey and dashed lines show more recent weekly survey after covid-19 crisis began. a further mitigating factor is that household savings rates appear to have risen, involuntarily and significantly, due to social distancing policies. a bank of england survey in conjunction with ipsos mori suggests the aggregate saving ratio is broadly unchanged, although with considerable heterogeneity across income cohorts (chart 12). but it is possible these survey respondents did not capture the involuntary increase in households cash balances when they answered questions about their savings behaviour.  for example, sterling deposits held by households and companies in banks have increased sharply over the past few months, by around 120 billion (chart 13). that is consistent with a significant rise in the saving ratio. these higher involuntary savings could be drawn down to finance future spending, at least by some households. in aggregate, they potentially dwarf any voluntary rise in savings for precautionary purposes. notes: research was carried out by ipsos mori on behalf of the bank of england. it surveyed a nationally representative quota sample of 2,243 adults in the united kingdom aged 16-75 using its online i:omnibus on 29 may to 3 june. data has been weighted to the known offline population proportions for age, gender, government office region, working status and social grade. respondents were asked, 201cas a result of the coronavirus pandemic, would you say that your household savings have increased, decreased, or stayed the same?which of these two paths will play out in practice? back in may, the mpc observed that the balance of risks to the outlook was skewed to the downside. subsequent positive news on demand has, in my opinion, more than counterbalanced the rise in downside risks to employment. to my mind, this leaves risks to the outlook slightly more evenly balanced than in may, if still with a downside skew. the fourth quarter looking beyond 2020, there is plainly a high degree of uncertainty about the economy. that in part reflects uncertainty about the virus and the policy responses to it. but it also reflects uncertainties about the path of the economy itself. given the depth of the recession, there is likely to be a greater than usual degree of history-dependence, or hysteresis, in this path. the deeper and longer the recession, the greater the scarring effects on physical and human capital and hence the economy's productive potential. the may mpr scenario captured some of these scarring effects. in particular, it assumed that lower investment as a result of the covid crisis was not recovered, leaving the capital stock 4% lower. combined with some drag on total factor productivity (tfp) growth, the level of output ended 100bd% lower. that scenario assumed no scarring effect on human capital, however, with unemployment returning to pre-covid levels and the long-run rate of unemployment unchanged at around 400%. at the same time, it was recognised that this was just one of many possible paths for the economy. other paths would give rise to differing degrees of scarring to physical and human capital and losses to the long-run productive potential of the economy. on 14 july, the office of budget responsibility (obr) will publish three possible scenarios for the economy involving different degrees of depth and length of the downturn. perhaps the key uncertainty, from a scarring perspective, concerns the labour market. as chart 2 illustrates, the covid crisis has had markedly different effects on different sectors and, most likely, will continue to do so. chart 14 compares different sectors contribution to the pre-covid employment boom and its subsequent output contraction. there is a negative correlation, suggesting it might be difficult for the sectors which absorbed most workers pre-covid to repeat this feat post-covid. notes: sectoral output hits on y-axis are from chart 2. numbers on x-axis are the percentage point contribution of each sector to total growth in uk employment from its post-global financial crisis trough to end-2019. other, structural, factors may further complicate the labour market picture. the covid crisis has shifted relative prices in ways which could encourage companies to invest in machines rather than people during the recovery. the price of capital goods has fallen while the price of labour has increased because of the need for covid-secure premises and practices."
3rd-Party - European Central Bank - Economic Bulletin (Jun-20).pdf,"Predictably, the ECB���s latest overview of the economic outlook offers a worrying analysis. The economic fallout from containment measures will be sharp and deep. Despite a sharp deterioration in the global outlook, risks to the ECB���s forecast are still skewed to the downside. The impact of the pandemic may prove to be stronger and longer lasting than currently expected. Euro-area activity saw an unprecedented fall in Q1 2020 with heterogeneous contraction across countries and sectors, the Q2 data is expected to paint even worse picture. A rebound is expected in the second half of 2020, however, its speed and scale remain highly uncertain.","economic and monetary developments overview at its monetary policy meeting on 4 june, the governing council decided to increase the envelope and extend the horizon for the pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp) and to reinvest its maturing principal payments, while continuing with the asset purchase program (app) and its reinvestments and keeping the key ecb interest rates unchanged. incoming information confirms that the euro area economy is experiencing an unprecedented contraction. there has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and the measures to contain it. severe job and income losses and exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook have led to a significant fall in consumer spending and investment. while survey data and real-time indicators for economic activity have shown some signs of a bottoming-out alongside the gradual easing of the containment measures, the improvement has so far been tepid compared with the speed at which the indicators plummeted in the preceding two months. the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area see growth declining at an unprecedented pace in the second quarter of this year, before rebounding again in the second half, crucially helped by the sizeable support from fiscal and monetary policy. nonetheless, the projections entail a substantial downward revision to both the level of economic activity and the inflation outlook over the whole projection horizon, though the baseline is surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. while headline inflation is suppressed by lower energy prices, price pressures are expected to remain subdued on account of the sharp decline in real gdp and the associated significant increase in economic slack. against this background, the governing council decided on a set of monetary policy measures to support the economy during its gradual reopening and to safeguard medium-term price stability. economic and monetary assessment at the time of the governing council meeting of 4 june 2020 the covid-19 epidemic has caused a sharp deterioration in the global outlook, as embedded in the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. the covid-19 pandemic has paralysed the global economy, with measures to contain the spread of the virus taken by governments across the globe being a driving factor behind the recent sharp decline in economic activity. several countries have recently started easing containment measures, but this process is likely to be very gradual. economic activity, especially in emerging market economies, has also been adversely affected by a sharp fall in commodity prices, tighter financial conditions and substantial capital outflows. incoming data confirm that the economic fallout from containment measures will be sharp and deep. in view of these severe global disruptions, the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections envisage that world real gdp ecb will contract by 4.0% this year. the pace of this contraction is faster and its magnitude greater than seen in the great recession. following a sharp contraction in the first two quarters of 2020, global activity is projected to start to recover in the third quarter and to increase by 6.0% and 3.9% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. global trade will be affected more severely, as logistics disruptions and closed borders amplify the impact of the fallout. despite a sharp deterioration in the global outlook, as embedded in the june projections, risks to this outlook are still skewed to the downside. most importantly, the impact of the pandemic may prove to be stronger and longer lasting than currently expected. although financial conditions in the euro area have loosened somewhat since the governing council's meeting in march 2020, they have not returned to the levels seen before the global spread of covid-19. over the review period (12 march 2020 to 3 june 2020) the forward curve of the euro overnight index average (eonia) shifted upwards. its inversion at short maturities is still present, albeit less so than on 12 march, signalling that market participants expectations of further policy rate cuts have diminished and shifted further out into the future. despite the monetary policy accommodation provided via the pepp and other policy measures, long-term euro area sovereign bond yields increased over the review period. prices of risky assets partly recovered from the losses incurred during february and march, mainly against the backdrop of an improvement in global risk sentiment and the perception that tail risks of an imminent global crisis have faded to some extent. in foreign exchange markets, the euro remained broadly stable in trade-weighted terms, with volatility in bilateral exchange rates reflecting uncertainty surrounding the covid-19 pandemic. euro area real gdp decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2020, and incoming data point to a further significant contraction of real gdp in the second quarter. the latest economic indicators and survey results confirm a sharp contraction of the euro area economy and rapidly deteriorating labour market conditions. the coronavirus pandemic and the necessary containment measures have severely affected both the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. most recent indicators suggest some bottoming-out of the downturn in may as parts of the economy gradually reopen. accordingly, euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although the overall speed and scale of the rebound remains highly uncertain. this assessment is also broadly reflected in the june 2020 euro system staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. in the baseline scenario of the projections, annual real gdp is expected to fall by 8.7% in 2020 and to rebound by 5.2% in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022. compared with the march 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real gdp growth has been revised substantially downwards by 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and revised upwards by 3.9 percentage points in 2021 and 1.9 percentage points in 2022. given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections also include two alternative scenarios. 1 in general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected. overall, the governing council sees the balance of risks around the baseline projection tilted to the downside. according to eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation decreased to 0.1% in may, down from 0.3% in april, mainly on account of lower energy price inflation. on the basis of current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline somewhat further over the coming months and to remain subdued until the end of the year. over the medium term, weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints. market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels. while survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term, longer-term expectations have been less affected. this assessment is also reflected in the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual hicp inflation in the baseline scenario at 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022. compared with the march 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for hicp inflation has been revised downwards by 0.8 percentage points in 2020, 0.6 percentage points in 2021 and 0.3 percentage points in 2022. annual hicp inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 0.8% in 2020, 0.7% in 2021 and 0.9% in 2022. the covid-19 pandemic caused a sharp acceleration in monetary dynamics, driven by acute liquidity needs of businesses to finance ongoing payments and strong preferences for money holdings for precautionary reasons among economic agents. broad money (m3) growth increased to 8.3% in april 2020, from 7.5% in march. the strong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which is being driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy. moreover, high economic uncertainty is triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons. the narrow monetary aggregate m1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity. the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 6.6% in april 2020, up from 5.5% in march, reflecting firms2019 need to finance their ongoing expenditure and working capital in the context of rapidly declining revenues. at the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households decreased to 3.0% in april, from 3.4% in march, amid consumption constraints due to the containment measures, declining confidence and a deteriorating labour market. the governing council's policy measures, in particular the very favourable terms for the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii), should encourage banks to extend loans to all private sector entities. together with the measures adopted by 1 see the eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, june 2020 published on the ecb's website on 4 june 2020.national governments and european institutions, the governing council's measures support ongoing access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on fiscal policies in the euro area. containment measures have also triggered unprecedented fiscal stimulus packages intended to cushion the economic fallout and to prepare for a swift recovery. as a result, the general government budget deficit in the euro area is projected to increase significantly in 2020, to 8.5% of gdp, compared with 0.6% in 2019. although the deficit ratio is expected to shrink to 4.9% in 2021, it is still expected to stand at 3.8% of gdp in 2022. overall the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to be strongly expansionary in 2020, but contractionary in 2021, as most support measures are expected to have been phased out by then. notwithstanding the negative fiscal stance in 2021, the overall fiscal balance will remain substantially negative with fiscal instruments continuing to support the economic recovery, not least through automatic stabilisers. an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy, although measures should be targeted and temporary. in this respect, both the  530 billion package of three safety nets endorsed by the european council and the european commission's proposal for a recovery plan dedicated to supporting the regions and sectors most severely hit by the pandemic are strongly welcomed. the monetary policy package a combination of two main factors called for additional monetary policy action. first, the pandemic-related downward revision to the inflation outlook poses a threat to the governing council's medium-term price stability mandate. second, while conditions in financial markets have stabilised substantially since the pepp announcement, financial conditions for the euro area as a whole remain significantly tighter today than in the pre-pandemic period, whereas the outlook for economic activity and inflation calls for easier financial conditions. against this background, on 4 june 2020, the governing council decided on a set of monetary policy measures to support the ongoing ample degree of monetary accommodation necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, in line with its mandate. 1. the governing council decided to increase the envelope for the pepp by 600 billion to a total of 1,350 billion. in response to the pandemic-related downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon, the pepp expansion will further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households. the purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. this allows the governing council to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. 2. the governing council decided to extend the horizon for net purchases under the pepp to at least the end of june 2021. this broadly aligns the purchase horizon with the horizons of the other monetary policy measures taken in response to the pandemic, such as tltro iii and the pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (peltros). in any case, the ecb will conduct net asset purchases under the pepp until the governing council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. 4. 3. the governing council decided to reinvest the maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the pepp until at least the end of 2022. in any case, the future roll-off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. the reinvestments will help to avoid the risk of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions while the economy is still recovering from the pandemic shock. at the same time, it is appropriate that the reinvestment strategy for the pepp reflects its temporary nature and link to the pandemic emergency. in addition, net purchases under the app will continue at a monthly pace of 20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional 120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. the governing council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the app to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of the ecb's policy rates, and to end shortly before the governing council starts raising the key ecb interest rates. 5. the governing council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. 6. finally, the governing council decided to keep the key ecb interest rates unchanged. these are expected to remain at their present or lower levels until the inflation outlook robustly converges to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within the projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, the governing council's decisions will support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions, in order to underpin the recovery of the economy from the coronavirus fallout. at the same time, in the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the governing council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. this applies first and foremost to the governing council's role in ensuring that its monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of the ecb's price stability mandate. the governing council, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.external environment the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic has paralysed the global economy. measures taken by governments across the globe to contain the spread of the virus imply a sharp decline in economic activity in the near term. while several countries have recently started easing containment measures, this process is likely to be very gradual. economic activity, especially in emerging market economies (emes), is also being adversely affected by sharply lower commodity prices, tighter financial conditions and substantial capital outflows. incoming data confirm that the economic fallout from the pandemic and containment measures will be heavy and far-reaching. in view of these severe global disruptions, the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections envisage that world real gdp (excluding the euro area) will contract by 4.0% this year. the pace of this contraction is faster and its magnitude greater than seen in the great recession. following a sharp contraction in the first two quarters of 2020, global activity is projected to start to recover in the third quarter. this profile implies that global activity is projected to increase by 6.0% and 3.9% in 2021 and 2022 respectively. global trade will be affected more severely, as logistics disruptions and closed borders amplify the impact of the fallout. moreover, trade is procyclical, responding to developments in economic activity, especially in downturns. despite a sharp deterioration in the global outlook, as embedded in the june projections, risks to this outlook are still skewed to the downside. most importantly, the impact of the pandemic may prove to be stronger and longer lasting than currently expected. other risks relate, for instance, to an increased sensitivity of financial markets to news, structural changes in supply networks for production and the risk of a rise in trade protectionism. global economic activity and trade the covid-19 pandemic has paralysed the global economy. measures taken by governments across the globe to contain the spread of the virus imply a sharp decline in economic activity in the near term. such measures were introduced in china in late january, while other countries enacted them later as the virus spread globally. while several countries have recently started easing containment measures, this process is likely to be very gradual. economic activity, especially in emes, is being adversely affected by sharply lower commodity prices, tighter financial conditions and substantial capital outflows. these severe global shocks hit the world economy at a time when signs of a stabilisation, following a period of lacklustre performance last year, had been increasingly evident. in particular, a nascent recovery in manufacturing activity and trade, led by large emes, had been under way at the turn of the year. moreover, the favourable global financial conditions prevailing at that time, as well as a partial de-escalation of the trade conflict between the united states and china following the signing of the 201cphase one201d trade agreement, had had the potential to reinforce the recovery before the pandemic struck. survey data confirm that the economic fallout from the pandemic and containment measures will be heavy and far-reaching. looking at sectoral data from the purchasing managers2019 index (pmi) survey, three patterns emerge. first, output plummeted across sectors as stringent containment measures were put in place. second, the impact on the services sector was greater than the impact on manufacturing. with containment policies suppressing supply and demand globally, output in both the manufacturing and services sectors has deteriorated much more rapidly than occurred during the great recession (see chart 1). third, as production resumes, output recovers from its depressed levels 2013 as seen recently in china. however, for several reasons, this recovery is only partial. these reasons relate to restrictions that still remain in place for businesses that require close social interaction; behavioural changes by consumers amid worries about a second wave of infections; and high uncertainty hindering investment decisions which, in turn, lowers demand in the near term and weighs on productive capacity in the longer term. the global composite output pmi (excluding the euro area) recovered somewhat in may, supported by better results for both the manufacturing and services sectors. however, it remains deep in contractionary territory. the data cover the period from january 1999 to may 2020. the global financial crisis sample (yellow dots) denotes the period from december 2007 to june 2009. the covid-19 pandemic sample (red dots) denotes the period from january 2020 to may 2020. the more cautious behaviour of consumers is reflected in a sharp decline in global confidence indicators. consumer confidence has deteriorated significantly in recent weeks, especially in advanced economies. in addition, the worsening labour market will lead consumers to adopt more cautious behaviour characterised by higher precautionary savings and lower consumption, particularly of durable goods. financial conditions tightened sharply, but some of this tightening has eased more recently. initially, the tightening was swift and broad-based, affecting advanced economies and emes alike. in addition, emes have seen substantial financial outflows in both gross and net terms, although the latest data suggest that these outflows have moderated or even reversed in recent weeks. despite these signs of a stabilisation, financial stress remains elevated, partly owing to an increase in the incidence of confirmed new cases of covid-19 and deaths in emes. notably, financial investors fled from emes indiscriminately in the initial phase of the crisis related to the pandemic, but differences in macroeconomic fundamentals and vulnerabilities across emes now seem to have become increasingly relevant for investment decisions. overall, financial conditions remain substantially tighter in both advanced economies and emes than before the pandemic struck. however, taking a longer-term perspective, they remain more favourable than in past global downturns, including the great recession and the recession that followed the bursting of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. in part, this may reflect the rapid and aggressive response of central banks around the world. most notably, monetary policy interventions are likely to be the key factor behind the stabilisation in sovereign bond yields and term premia, despite the unprecedented level of global sovereign debt issuance necessitated by the pandemic. uncertainty increased substantially and remains elevated. while it is still too early to judge what role elevated uncertainty has played in the current crisis, it is likely to weigh on the recovery prospects. the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections envisage that world real gdp (excluding the euro area) will decline by 4.0% this year. the pace of this contraction is faster and its magnitude much greater than seen in the great recession. following a sharp contraction in the first two quarters of 2020, economic activity is projected to recover from the third quarter. as lockdowns are lifted, activity is projected to rebound initially, but the overall pace of the recovery is assumed to be gradual owing to social distancing measures kept in place and also owing to changing consumer behaviour. looking further ahead, the june 2020 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections envisage that global activity will increase by 6.0% in 2021 and 3.9% in 2022. compared with the march 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections, global growth has been revised significantly down for this year, while growth over the medium-term horizon is expected to be slightly stronger. these revisions also imply that the level of global output remains below the trajectory projected in the march 2020 ecb staff macroeconomic projections. for emes, the recovery is expected to be more subdued than those seen after previous downturns. this reflects the combination of negative shocks affecting emes at the current juncture, including the pandemic crisis, tight financial conditions, negative terms of trade shocks for commodity exporters, and substantial capital outflows. in the united states, the pace of the contraction in economic activity is estimated to have accelerated in the second quarter of 2020. real gdp declined by 5.0% on an annualised basis in the first quarter, according to the second estimate. this contraction was slightly larger than reported in the advance estimate. higher frequency data suggest that the economic downturn deepened further in the second quarter, as strict containment measures were in place across the country in april. from late april us states started to gradually ease the containment measures, which should help to support a recovery in the second half of 2020. it will be led by a recovery in domestic demand backed by the strong economic policy support enacted to date. however, the recovery is projected to be gradual, as consumer confidence remains at depressed levels amid unprecedented job destruction recorded since late march. employment decreased by more than 22 million jobs and the unemployment rate reached 14.7% in april. annual headline consumer price inflation dropped sharply to 0.3% in april, from 1.5% in the previous month. excluding food and energy, annual inflation declined to 1.4% in april from 2.1% in march. inflation is expected to decline this year, as the disinflationary effects of the demand shock outweigh inflationary effects stemming from supply disruptions, and is projected to gradually increase to stand closer to the federal reserve system's 2% target towards the end of the projection horizon. in china, the recovery is proceeding amid strong headwinds. these include weak external demand prospects in the near term, as evidenced by the sharp fall in export orders, and a gradual recovery in domestic demand. the latter reflects the remaining social distancing measures in place, as well as generally more cautious consumer behaviour. the monetary and policy stimulus enacted by the authorities will help to support economic activity. looking ahead, activity is projected to recover over the projection horizon. however, this recovery is assumed to remain muted compared with the level of activity foreseen in the march projections. in japan, the economy has slipped into a technical recession. activity declined in the fourth quarter of last year owing to a confluence of negative shocks, including a fall in domestic demand as a result of the consumption tax hike, production disruptions caused by powerful typhoons in october, and weak external demand. subsequently, amid the covid-19 outbreak, real gdp contracted further, declining by 0.9% in the first quarter of 2020. authorities2019 efforts to contain the virus weighed on domestic demand, especially private consumption of services and semi-durable goods. notably, exports of services fell markedly, reflecting lower spending by inbound tourists owing to the travel restrictions imposed in reaction to the outbreak. the japanese authorities stepped up policy support for the ailing economy. in april the bank of japan raised the limits on purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds, eased access to corporate funding facilities and purchased short-term and longer-term government bonds. at its emergency meeting in may it decided to launch a new fund-provisioning measure for banks to support lending to small and medium-sized enterprises. in late may the japanese government approved a second fiscal stimulus package that is broadly comparable in size to the one implemented in april 2020. these measures should provide further stimulus to the economy, which is projected to gradually recover from the second half of this year. in the united kingdom, the economic situation has deteriorated significantly. real gdp fell by 2% in the first quarter of 2020, even though the economy was locked down for just the last ten days of march, while annual consumer price inflation fell to 0.8% in april, down sharply from 1.5% in the previous month. while the furlough scheme has helped to maintain employment, the labour market situation has deteriorated markedly. experimental ons data on benefit claimants 2013 covering the unemployed, as well as those receiving in-work benefits 2013 showed that by mid-april more than two million citizens were claiming some form of benefit. this is around one-third more than the number observed during the great recession. high frequency data signal a further marked deterioration in the second quarter, which implies a much more severe recession than occurred in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. the government has announced a phased reopening of the economy, which is expected to support a gradual recovery in the coming months. in central and eastern european countries, economic activity is expected to weaken substantially. a large number of countries in the region recorded negative growth in the first quarter of 2020, amid supply disruptions and weaker demand caused by containment measures. looking ahead, a much deeper downturn is expected in the second quarter. this reflects the interplay of weaker domestic demand 2013 as the containment measures remained in place throughout april 2013 with weaker external demand, especially from the euro area countries. economic activity in large commodity-exporting countries is expected to fall precipitously. in russia, the economy has been buffeted by recent energy market developments and by the covid-19 pandemic, taking a toll on external demand. at the same time, there has been a steep rise in new domestic cases of infection, resulting in a tightening of measures to contain the spread of the virus.

iPhone data shows passenger-km traveled by private and shared micromobility vehicles has decreased 60%-70% in Europe and U.S.; sector expected to make a strong post-pandemic recovery growing at 5%-10% beginning in 2022.","the future of micro mobility: ridership and revenue after a crisis the covid-19 crisis is causing serious disruptions to the multibillion- dollar micromobility industry. our analysis indicates that a full recovery is possible, as long as companies prepare for the next normal.the covid-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide, bankrupted businesses, and plunged the global economy into crisis. while lockdown measures and shelter-at-home orders are helping contain the coronavirus, they have also brought severe financial hardship. amid a new reality of working from home, canceling trips, and even forgoing outings to restaurants and grocery stores, the micromobility industry encompassing a range of lightweight vehicles such as bicycles, e-scooters, and mopeds is facing devasting declines in ridership and revenue.the blow to micromobility came just as the industry was accelerating. in 2019, a banner year, our models predicted that the micromobility industry would be a $300 billion to $500 billion market by 2030. our benchmark assessment of micromobility's potential impact on the city of munich also suggested good things ahead. then, the pandemic hit. with the number of passenger-kilometers traveled declining 50 to 60 percent worldwide since the onset of the covid-19 crisis, use of micromobility solutions has declined dramatically. to determine the full impact of the pandemic on this sector, as well as on future developments, we examined micromobility over three time horizons (exhibit 1): 2014 short term. what effect is the global lockdown having on micromobility now? 2014 medium term. will we see a complete recovery, and what will the next normal look like? 2014 long term. what effects will the pandemic have on our 2030 market modeling? this article is part of a series on the future of mobility after the covid-19 crisis.1 short term: spiked valuations and more bicycle lanesin our short-term analysis, we examined the impact of the global pandemic on micromobility by examining the response of the industry itself, consumers, and cities. micromobility-service providers are strugglingthe global lockdown is profoundly affecting service-provider valuations, workers employed in the sector, and the speed of industry consolidation. for example, the valuation of one company operating a worldwide network of e-bikes and e-scooters recently dropped by a reported 79 percent. another provider halted operations in six us cities and all of its european markets, laying off 30 percent of its workforce. a third company cut working hours for 60 percent of its staff while supplying a streamlined fleet of its e-scooters to healthcare workers in germany. the lockdown has also accelerated industry-consolidation moves. for example, a micromobility company recently acquired the e-bicycle and e-scooter business of a major ride-hailing company.consumer behavior is shifting rapidlyin response to measures to control the covid-19 pandemic, such as shelter-at-home orders, local travel preferences are quickly changing. one example is the preference for longer trips. according to a us micromobility company that rents e-scooters, average trip distances have grown 26 percent since the start of the pandemic, with rides in some cities, such as detroit, increasing by up to 60 percent. at a more detailed level, some cities are also experiencing a shift in consumer use cases. for instance, in san francisco, the lockdown has caused a pronounced shift toward runs to the pharmacy and trips to restaurants to pick up food. cities are offering greater support for biking worldwide, the lockdown has driven new citywide policies. one major result is an increased focus on bicycle lanes. consider the following: 2014 milan has announced that 35 kilometers of streets previously used by cars will be transitioned to walking and cycling lanes after the lockdown is lifted.1 our analysis is part of an ongoing effort to recalibrate our perspective and modeling on mobility, taking into consideration both covid-19- crisis and long-term trends. we integrated our micromobility modeling into the broader mckinsey mobility modern marketing model (m3), which analyzes the current and future development and interaction of all modes of transportation over the next decade. by doing so, we can investigate the relationship between micromobility and other future mobility modes.2the future of micromobility: ridership and revenue after a crisis exhibit 1the micromobility sector is expected to

turning 40 kilometers of car lanes into cycle paths. 2014 seattle permanently closed 30 kilometers of streets to most vehicles, providing more space for people to walk and bike following the lockdown. 2014 montreal announced the creation of more than 320 kilometers of new pedestrian and bicycle paths across the city. midterm: recovery and the next normals the pandemic wanes in some locations, it is natural to wonder when people will start to travel again. based on an analysis of apple iphone data, the number of passenger-kilometers traveled by private and shared micromobility vehicles has decreased by an estimated 60 to 70 percent in europe and the united states. interestingly, the same data source already shows a u-shape recovery; extrapolating this trend indicates a recovery to precrisis levels of travel .to determine if and when micromobility would recover, we conducted a global consumer survey in 3the future of micromobility: ridership and revenue after a crisis may 2020. it included more than 7,000 respondents from seven global markets2014china, france, germany, italy, japan, the united kingdom, and the united states. our goal was to investigate consumer mobility behaviors and expectations before, during, and after the crisis.according to our consumer survey, the use of micromobility might increase. it showed that the number of respondents willing to use micromobility in the next normal on a regular basis will increase by 9 percent for private micromobility and by 12 percent for shared micromobility compared to precrisis levels. given these trends, we believe that private- and shared-micromobility solutions will experience a complete recovery in the number of passenger-kilometers traveled, with no significant drop from precrisis levels. we also believe that mobility in general will fully return to precrisis levels. some consumer priorities and usage patterns are changingwhile the industry itself will persevere, micromobility will undoubtedly look different after the crisis as it enters the next normal. take consumer behavior, for instance. prior to the pandemic, our consumer surveys revealed that the main pain point felt by regular users of shared micromobility was the time to destination. now, it is the risk of infection (exhibit 2). when asked in our may 2020 survey about measures that would increase the consumer likelihood of using shared-micromobility services, 47 percent of respondents cited regular disinfection of equipment, 43 percent said physical distancing from the previous or next user, and 31 percent said user-health checks. while consumer concerns are changing, ridership preferences by age will likely remain static. in private micromobility, we expect to see a similar split across all age groups, precrisis and postcrisis (exhibit 3). currently, about half of all shared-micromobility users are younger than 34, with the fewest users older than 55. based on our consumer surveys, we do not anticipate a change of this ratio in the postpandemic era.mobility patterns will likely changeas seen during the covid-19 crisis, average trip distances might increase, since people will use micromobility solutions more often when commuting. in our 2019 global aces2 consumer survey, less than 20 percent of all shared-micromobility trips typically involved commuting. however, this survey also indicated that more than 70 percent of respondents would consider buying a private e-scooter for everyday commutes to work or school. this shift could boost private ownership in the e-scooter market.our consumer survey reveals that risk of infection has become the top concern. our consumer survey reveals that risk of infection has become the top concern. main concerns when choosing shared micromobility, ranked by

pandemic, we expect that ridership preference by age will after the covid-19 pandemic, we expect that ridership preference by age will likely remain static. beforecovid-19 during pandemic return to normal life industry consolidation will continue to accelerate with drastic decreases in ridership and revenue, shared-micromobility providers find themselves in a more precarious position and this could continue the accelerated consolidation of companies. in turn, greater acceleration could improve the business case for micromobility providers and increase profitability, given the synergies and scale-efficiency improvements that occur when buying larger volumes of vehicles, processing more payment transactions, and capturing greater back-office scale effects, along with a higher number of insurance fees. furthermore, cities may reduce their permit fees to support micromobility as an alternative to private-car ownership after the covid-19 crisis. for example, our analysis shows that the profitability of shared e-scooters could increase by up to five percentage points in the next normal .long term: more micromobility travel in the next normalwe believe that micromobility will emerge intact and thrive in the long term. indeed, our estimates for 2030 predict a boost of 5 to 10 percent in the number of passenger-kilometers traveled compared with our base case. this increase will come from several trends.first, according to our consumer survey, people are now more willing to regularly use micromobility; in addition, average trip distances could increase, as observed during the covid-19 crisis, leading to a higher revenue per trip. what's more, higher awareness about personal hygiene and physical distancing might encourage consumers to use micromobility, rather than public transportation, for short trips. other trends relate to private-car usage. this form of transport could increase in cities in the next normal as people practice physical distancing to prevent transmission of covid-19. overall, private cars are seen as a safer mode of travel, especially when compared with public transit. as noted earlier, cities might enact measures to deincentivize and regulate private-car ownership, such as instituting higher parking fees, taxes, and tolls. they might also invest more in biking infrastructure or even repurpose whole streets to incentivize micromobility use. furthermore, following the example of italy, the industry could lower up-front costs for consumers by establishing purchasing premiums for bicycles, e-scooters, and mopeds. they may also enact mileage allowances for those using micromobility for commuting.micromobility will likely increase in profitability in the next normal.micromobility will likely increase in profitability in

estimates and interviews; press and web research; mckinsey analysisfinally, consumers could become more aware of the value of sustainable and noise-reducing transportation modes after experiencing them during lockdowns. micromobility might thus emerge as a leading option for riders who want to protect the environment.the global pandemic has transformed the way people think about travel, including micromobility. the short-term consequences have been profound, with micromobility declining as people reassess their transportation options. however, given current consumer sentiment, policy actions, and the potential for upside, we expect the industry to emerge stronger from this crisis."

3rd-Party - Innovations for Last-Mile Parcel Delivery Companies (Jul-20).pdf,"As parcel delivery companies face increasing competition from digital-native startups and ecommerce giants, they must create intimacy with package receivers to prevent delivery service commoditization. Consulting firm BCG recommends several innovations for them to create that intimacy, including personalized delivery options, simplifying returns, assigning delivery personnel to regular routes, providing apps to enable real-time tracking, offering sustainable delivery practices, and rewarding receiver loyalty. Parcel delivery firms should also invest in deploying digital capabilities more comprehensively, and should partner with retailers, tech startups, and even other delivery firms where it makes sense.","parcel delivery companies were in a tough spot even before the coronavirus pandemic struck. then, as online shopping spiked during the lockdowns instituted to curb the pandemic, companies had to scramble to meet increased demand from shippers for residential deliveries. the transition from relatively stable demand to accelerated growth has forced some postal and parcel companies to bring on inex00adperienced or temporary workers. the crisis also has forced parcel players to institute stricter safety measures to protect both customers and employees. as lockdowns end and regions begin to settle into the new reality, challenges that existed prior to the crisis are likely to return in full force. these include package thefts, traffic in urban centers, and more demand to handle oversized, oddly shaped or other wise irregular packages. such challenges have resulted in less than stellar service even as consumers have become conditioned to expect deliveries to be fast and, in many cases, free. at the same time, delivery services are being commoditized, with large shippers such as amazon, walmart, and alibaba moving closer to becoming competitors. parcel players must overcome this precarious position without adding to constrained budgets while simultaneously maintaining strong ties with package shippers. to succeed, we believe they must form deeper, seamless, and digitally enabled engagement with package receivers by using technology to track where and when consumer and small business customers want deliveries and offering receivers the flexibility to make last minute changes as needed. companies also must empower delivery drivers, giving them ready access to package receivers' preferences among other things, as a way to establish a better rapport. finally, companies must offer more services, such as managing more aspects of merchandise returns and exchanges. taking steps to improve what we call receiver intimacy may sound like old news to some players. but many others have yet to start the journey. if they can, then both they and the retail partners whose shipments they fulfill will benefit. parcel companies that can't create this virtuous cycle could find themselves losing market share and, in the long run, watching the future of the industry pass them by. the e-commerce effect in the past decade, digitization has been the driving force behind the rise of e-commerce, the proliferation of groundbreaking technologies, and dramatic changes in customer expectations, all of which have reshaped parcel delivery services. at the same time, the delivery business has been disrupted by an onslaught of new rivals, including e00adcommerce giants and digital native startups. in many cases, performance at traditional parcel and package delivery companies has failed to keep up with consumer expectations. in an analysis of 500 online reviews of global parcel companies, we found that 219 included complaints about inaccuracies in package dropoff locations. the reviews also included 181 mentions of how complaints were handled. such service issues threaten to tarnish the industry's image as trustworthy and reliable, two characteristics upon which parcel companies have long relied for a competitive edge.meanwhile, ecommerce players such as amazon and alibaba have used their considerable size and financial clout to establish logistics and delivery operations in order to create a seamless experience from shopping to unboxing, cutting into traditional package delivery companies market share. ecommerce companies superior capitalization has enabled them to spend more on strategic initiatives. their origins as online platforms gave them a head start over incumbent parcel delivery companies as digital took on a larger role in the ecommerce supply chain. increased competition from ecommerce players and digital00adnative startups has pressured parcel companies financials. from 2014 through 2016, total shareholder return for two thirds of the parcel companies we analyzed outperformed local stock market indexes. since then, shareholder return for three out of four of those com panies has fallen below the same indexes. parcel companies must address changing industry dynamics before conditions get worse. in their favor, they have consider00companiesributes that they can deploy to strengthen their relationship with receiv00aders. the most significant of these are a substantial physical distribution network; high delivery density; efficiently run, large00adscale operations; and healthy international connections that facilitate the smooth flow of goods across borders. in addition, in00adcumbent parcel companies have solid, long00adstanding relationships with many small and large shippers and extensive data on order patterns and receiver prefer00adences culled from decades of deliveries. they also benefit from being on people's doorsteps all the time, in some cases every day, giving them a solid base upon which to build a better data00adenabled personal engagement with those receivers. creating a virtuous cycle of receiver intimacytraditionally, parcel companies focused on cultivating relationships with shippers and prioritized increasing density to reduce costs. this allowed them to attrintimacy traditionallych further increased density and so on.the fundamental economics of the busi00adness haven2019t changed: cost is and will be the dominant driver in the industry. but as we previously pointed out, e00adcommerce players have reset receivers2019 expectations for deliveries, and their exponential growth is driving a fundamental shift in the market. those expectations play a sufadstantial role when consumers choose which online retailers to patronize and what to buy. if a consumer has a bad delivery experience with an online retailer, it cosubstantial to shop elsewhere.if parcel companies can broaden their operations to cultivate closer connections with receivers, it could benefit their boston consulting group | why parcel companies need to make every delivery special 2 existing relationships with shippers and increase receiver intimacy. (see exhibit 1.) how does this work? when a parcel com00adpany takes a receiver's preferences into account, the number of attempts needed to successfully deliver a package decline. successful deliveries lead package receivers to feel more confident about making pur00adchases online, which leads to more online purchases and, therefore, more package deliveries. and a higher volume of package deliveries can lead to lower delivery costs, as well as more data on receiver behavior that can be used to fine00adtune operations and plan other services. how to cultivate receiver intimacyparcel companies must use their existing advantages, along with technology innovation, to create a more seamless delivery experience. we have identified five ways they can put those resources to work today. (see exhibit 2.) we believe that the first three steps offering individually tailored touch points, simplifying returns, and building a person00adal connection2014will become standard prac00adtice for all successful industry players. the last two, adopt it touch points . receiver intimacy unlocks a virtuous value cyclepractices and rewarding receiver loyalty, are more likely to be adopted initially by emerging companies that are digital na00adtives and need an edge to separate cycle practices from the competition, but eventually they could be adopted by any companies that want to move to the head of the pack. offer individually tailored touch points. parcel companies can analyze historical orders and receiver preference data to offer flexible delivery options, including where and when a package is dropped off. for example, a parcel company could use a receiver's order history to suggest delivering a package to their office or a secure package locker during work hours, or to their home during evenings or weekends. they could also coordinate with the receiver to drop off multiple packages at the same time. during times of crisis such as the covid19 pandemic when many people have shifted to working from home, carriers could redirect deliveries that normally would have been made to an office.carriers such as ups, dhl, and hermes already offer such personalized service. package receivers who sign up for the services can leave instructions for where a parcel should be left on the back porch, for instance, or in their apartment building's more effcient, individualized deliveries improve outcomes for parcel players and their shipping partners reduced costs and improved experience for shippers and receivers increased delivery density and success rate deeper knowledge and insights into receivers reduced . five ways to cultivate receiver intimacy offer individually tailored touchpoints reward receiver loyalty simplify returns engage receivers in sustainable delivery practices build a personal connection. most alerts include an estimated delivery time window, or receivers can pay a small fee for guaranteed drop offs within a specific period of time. if receivers know they will not be home, they can reroute a package to their office, a neighbor's home, or a designated retail location. simplify returns. to solidify their relationship with receivers, companies should assume more responsibility for aspects of merchandise returns. those activities could include sending alerts to receivers when the return period for something they ordered is about to expire, offering return labels and packaging, and inspecting merchandise to make sure that it fits the shippers return policies. parcel companies could consider offering such a service themselves or through a thirdparty partner. build personal connections. parcel companies can use technology to optimize the connection with receivers at a competitive cost. to create a seamless experience, they can assign delivery personnel to regular routes so receivers recognize them. they also can use technology to give receivers realtime information about a package's delivery status, and provide drivers with data on receivers preferences so that when they're making a delivery to new parents, for instance, they know not to ring the doorbell. at the same time, companies can take a cue from ridehailing services and offer receivers mobile apps that provide information about the driver who'll be delivering a package. companies might consider empowering drivers to take the initiative when something about a delivery isn2019t right, for example, authorizing them to waive a delivery charge if a package doesn't arrive within the guaranteed window.to incentivize delivery personnel to provide the best possible service, companies should compensate them on parameters such as receiver experience and not just on the quantity of packages delivered. companies and regulators must also ensure that delivery personnel are treated fairly, including offering competitive compensation, a safe work environment, and training on relevant skills, whether those personnel are employees or contractors. this could reduce turnover, which in turn would lower hiring and training costs, and retaining experienced personnel could help manage in00adcreases in package flow. engage receivers in sustainable delivery practices. parcel companies that want to set themselves further apart from the competition could take additional steps to appeal to package receivers while also enhancing their bottom line. one way to accomplish this would be by taking advantage of consumers' growing interest in sustainability. parcel companies could, for example, offer receivers the option of grouping deliveries together to minimize fuel consumption, which would also cut delivery costs. to do this, they would need to secure receivers' permission to deliver orders from multiple senders at the same time or to deliver orders to a dropoff location in their neighborhood. depending on where they operate, parcel players could also offer receivers the option of paying a small surcharge to have orders delivered on an energy efficient vehicle. companies could also reduce packag00ading or use packaging that can be reused or recycled. sf express, a chinese parcel delivery company, offers a recyclable delivery box that can be used up to 50 times, with a carbon footprint that is less than 10% of that of single use cardboard boxes.reward receiver loyalty. to make themselves more appealing, companies should consider finding new ways to cater to receivers. one option: loyalty programs that reward receivers for behaviors that benefit both themselves and the delivery company, such as opting to have packages delivered to a package locker, or being home when a package is due to be delivered. market conditions vary considerably by geography, so the steps a company takes to improve receiver intimacy will depend on where they operate. in some parts of the world, homes don't have assigned street addresses, while in other areas deliveries are made to specific gps coordinates. in some areas, making deliveries to parcel lockers is common practice, while in other places packages are routinely dropped at a consumer's home or a business office. whatever steps companies take to improve receiver intimacy must take into consideration what is possible, acceptable, or attractive in the markets they serve. taking other actions across the organizationas ecommerce giants expand and late stage startups attract investments for digital innovations, parcel companies can't wait. they must strengthen receiver intimacy and support that effort through related actions, including upgrading their supply chain, building digital capabilities, and solidifying partnerships in their delivery ecosystem. future-proof the supply chain. to provide the delivery experience that receivers want, companies need to build out or improve their existing supply chain and the technology architecture that supports it. they need to move away from running experiments around the fringes of their supply chain, and ramp up services that are relevant to specific geographies or customer segments. they also need to use existing resources more efficiently, including leveraging scale in order to combine multiple parcel orders into a single delivery point, thereby increasing package delivery density.build and deploy digital capabilities. to bolster their core business, companies need to adopt digital innovations for functions such as finance and human resources. they may need to outsource noncore functions, such as implementing a new crm system, to free up internal resources for supply chain capabilities that are specific to parcel delivery, such as research and development of dynamic routing algorithms and autonomous delivery vehicles team up parcel delivery companies may need to expand their delivery ecosystem through partnerships with other businesses to provide a more seamless eommerce and shipping experience for receivers than they could generate on their own. parcel companies need to strategize in advance with retailers and other existing shipping partners on the steps that they can take together to boost receiver intimacy. in addition, parcel players could partner with tech startups, which could provide the latest digital platforms and know how to help them scale their digital capabilities. finally, parcel companies could team up with international partners for help untanglinteam-up border issues. these partners could also share in investments, such as in lastmile delivery technologies.the future of the parcel industry is being shaped today. many companies with a vested interest in deliveries are taking action, including longtime retailers, ecommerce giants, startups, and grocery chains with large online footprints. parcel players must make sure that they are driving the future, rather than being led. if not, they could find themselves relegated to serving as mere delivery mechanisms, which could further depress revenue and margins. by taking the steps we would have outlined to build receiver intimacy they give themselves a better chance for success. but they need to act now."

software. the potential impact of each of these emerging technologies is unquestionable. and when they converge, their impact on organizational growth is almost inconceivable.new technologies are no longer just about doing things better, faster, and cheaper. they now have implications for survival and growth in new business reality. emerging technologies are transforming every industry, requiring legacy businesses to radically reinvent themselves faster than they ever imagined. the covid-19 pandemic has further reinforced the importance of driving enterprise transformation using technology as an enabler. technology underpins nearly every change triggered or accelerated by the crisis. emerging technologies that enable automation, artificial intelligence, powerful computing, connected devices and equipment, massive data transfer, collaboration, and business resilience are heroes in these turbulent times, helping enterprises recover from the initial impacts of covid-19 and set a strong foundation for the future. for example, many industries are fast-tracking the use of automation and robotics to supplement human labor. the need to ramp up digital commerce offerings has spurred wider adoption of cloud-enabled digital, analytics and machine learning technologies. companies are investing in myriad technologies, such as iot, blockchain, ai, predictive analytics, drones and extended reality, to make supply chains more resilient and transparent. from work-at-home models to more effective supply chains, technology is emerging as a core component of how every company operates. the impact of the pandemic is affecting every industry, but in very different ways. through this unprecedented change in the way we engage, some industries are surging and experiencing strong growth, while others are on the verge of collapse absent significant intervention. following the shutdown, when human contact was not possible, companies that were able to remotely connect with employees and customers and manage current operations demonstrated a level of resilience that increased trust in the business. markets gained confidence that these businesses would not only survive, but perhaps even thrive. the collaborative study between kpmg international and hfs research underpinning this paper helped to prove that, no matter the industry or the path to recovery, the financial and social impacts of the pandemic are driving a massive shift in business priorities and objectives. the path forward requires an accelerated digital transformation of organizations business and operating models in order to ensure long-term growth and margin improvement. hesitant organizations are likely to be flattened by savvier competitors that push the edges of innovation. kpmg

existed before the covid-19 crisis. now they have more urgency than ever. how can we take full advantage of emerging technologies to drive competitive advantage?what should our emerging technology roadmap look like?how will we capture and measure the true value of our emerging technology investments?what is the best approach to managing emerging technology risks?to what extent can we accelerate digital transformation across the enterprise?where do we start?at the same time, however, enterprises are challenged to keep pace with the exponential rate of technology innovation and the need to quantify the return on their investments. while covid-19 has created a burning platform for digital transformation, companies knee-jerk reaction after the pandemic shock has been to reduce technology investments and question technology's ability to drive value across the enterprise.despite the challenges of emerging technology adoption and deployment, there is no turning back. navigating through today's challenges, and seizing tomorrow's opportunities, requires enterprises to reboot their vision, strategy, and operating models to capitalize on the evolving technology landscape.to help guide the way, kpmg and hfs research are pleased to share enterprise reboot, a research report focused on driving tangible value from emerging technologies in the new reality. drawing insights from global survey data and first-person interviews, the report seeks to assess the current and future state of emerging technology adoption, explore the challenges of value realization, and reveal how organizations can fully capitalize on technology's promise. our research reflects the perspectives of hundreds of enterprise technology leaders around the world, as well as kpmg and hfs research thought leaders, and global luminaries. these are challenging times, with technology advancement creating both immense disruption and opportunity, as well as lingering uncertainty about where to focus

enterprise's investment and adoption of emerging technology. all respondents held executive-level positions at global 2000 enterprises with us $1b+ annual revenue, operating across nine business sectors and nine countries (australia, canada, france, germany, india, japan, the netherlands, the u.k, and the u.s.). survey data was supplemented by qualitative, in-depth interviews with enterprise leaders who oversee the investment and adoption of these emerging technologies in their organizations. the margin of error for this research is +/- 4.6 percentage points (4% on survey i and 6% on survey ii) at the 95 percent confidence level.research was conducted in two phases: a march-april 2020 survey conducted when many countries were starting to see the impact of the covid-19 pandemic (phase i) and a may-june 2020 survey conducted when many economies and societies were shut down due to the virus (phase ii). the sample between the two survey phases was primarily balanced by industry and revenue. by conducting two phases of research, we sought to achieve a fuller picture of the impact of the pandemic on enterprise approaches to emerging technology adoption and the sentiment toward the evolving emerging technology landscape. to ensure consistent interpretations throughout the survey and between the two phases of research, we presented respondents with definitions of each technology covered in the survey, including process automation, artificial intelligence (ai), smart analytics, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, blockchain, 5g, edge computing, internet of things (iot), augmented/virtual reality (ar/vr), cyber security, quantum computing, and trusted data backbone .executives say the pandemic has created an impetus to accelerate their digital transformation initiatives, yet average investments in emerging technologies have been slashed. covid-19 creates a burning platform for organizational change, but with enterprises facing a cash crunch, there are fewer funds available to invest in enabling technology. only 13 percent expect to significantly increase investments in emerging technologies as a direct result of covid-19.key findings business priorities have shifted overnight.57% of executives say covid-19 has significantly changed their organization's strategic priorities for emerging technologies. the immediate focus is survival, which has become the #1 objective for most emerging technology investments. meanwhile, making the business case has emerged as the primary challenge to realizing value from emerging technologies.resiliency requires a completely new playbook. 59% spending cuts for enabling technologies are likely short term.over months, executives expect to increase spending across nearly all technology areas as the they seek out ways to reboot the enterprise and get fit for the new reality. so, while edge computing, next blockchain, ai and 5g are seeing deeper investment reductions during the pandemic, these spending cuts aren't permanent. the crisis is driving clarity in technology investments.56%the power of and is greater than the power of or 64%with higher investments comes more realized value.more than80% of companies are investing or planning to invest in emerging technologies. organizations in the highest investment quartile are seeing substantially greater returns than organizations in the lowest investment quartile, in some cases achieving more than 20 percent greater value from their emerging technology investments. executives agree that cloud migration has become an absolute necessity. as they plot a path toward recovery, many enterprises are zeroing in on mature technologies such as cloud, automation, and analytics that will drive quick roi. these three technology areas are gaining additional focus. of executives believe that the combined use of emerging technologies is much more beneficial than using any of the technologies in isolation. ai-powered and cloud-enabled are emerging as the foundation. they are featured in more than 1/3 of all technology solutions.enterprise reboot .new technology essential for survival from the earliest stages of the crisis, covid-19 illuminated a clear link between digital preparedness and business resilience. our survey found that enterprises with the right digital-centric mindset prior to covid-19 have been much more successful at weathering the storm, recovering quickly at scale, and building a strong foundation for the future business environment.now, as enterprises deal with the prolonged fallout from the crisis, there is growing recognition of the importance of emerging technology to the future business. according to our survey, nearly 60 percent of executives agree that covid-19 has created an impetus to accelerate digital transformation initiatives. our observations with clients also support this finding. as we help businesses respond to and recover from the impacts of covid-19, it has become evident that an organization's ability to harness and leverage emerging technologies in transformation efforts will determine their ability to thrive in a changed business environment. we have seen that industries with strong digital transformation execution, such as online retail, telemedicine, food delivery, and streaming media, had the opportunity to scale aggressively during the recovery, which should last going forward given changing consumer behavior during the pandemic.the pandemic is also proving that emerging technology can deliver much more than a slight competitive edge it often spells the difference between success and failure.fifty-seven percent of executives say covid-19 has significantly changed their organization's strategic priorities. the objectives of emerging technology investments are shifting in step. in the phase 1 survey, growth goals like cost reduction, improved brand value, and clearer decisions were all at the top of the list. in phase ii2014when many economies and societies were shut down due to the virus2014objectives have become much clearer: the number one aim of emerging technology investments for nearly all companies surveyed is future survival. 57% of executives surveyed said covid-19 significantly impacted their businesses strategic priorities.4 enterprise reboot industry insight: philips covid-19 has accelerated new technology adoption and prompted enterprises to use technologies that were already available, however overlooked or underutilized. philips2019 teleradiology solutions have been on the market for more than a decade and the technology is now being used at scale to help a growing number of radiologists do remote readings from the safety of their homes.ai and predictive analytics promise to become key tools in the fight against the covid-19 virus itself. leveraging imaging and monitoring solutions, philips is working with clinical partners to create models that anticipate patient needs for medical equipment and icu beds and plan accordingly. by gathering signals from early stage diagnostics and other health information, the technology could enable hospitals to predict how many covid-19 patients will need to be admitted to an icu or put on a ventilator. systems for teleradiology have been available for years. but covid-19 has dramatically expanded the number of hospitals and medical practices that leverage teleradiology at scale, with radiologists working from home or remotely. we now see these technologies being used to help overloaded radiologists on the front lines of the covid-19 crisis manage suddenly heavier workloads safely and efficiently. since the pandemic began, emerging technologies all along the spectrum have been embraced out of necessity. as a result of covid-19, more companies are leveraging technology to make immediate operational changes (such as enabling remote work, diversifying the portfolio, expanding delivery, and automating processes) than to drive new growth (such as pursuing acquisitions). meanwhile, as the pandemic has progressed, making the business case has emerged as the primary challenge to realizing value from emerging technologies.developing the business case and securing commitment from the c-suite have emerged as the top 2 challenges to realizing value from emerging technologies. additionally, companies are no longer afraid of failure. risk of failure has moved from the secondary challenge to number seven on the list of challenges to realizing value from emerging technologies.lack of talent developing the

surge in digital commerce, and renewing focus on supply chain localization. in working with clients and tracking marketplace signals, kpmg professionals are seeing two business success drivers that are being pushed to the forefront during these unprecedented times: technology and trust.the fact is that rapid development, adoption and integration of technology does have the potential to increase risk across the business. and we know that trust is essential for digital transformation to go forward, but it was already eroding prior to covid-19. now, the crisis has intensified prior trust challenges and generated new ones. visible trust gaps for emerging technologies such as ai, blockchain and iot continue to remain significant barriers to adoption. i believe that organizations will have to get trust right for successful deployment of emerging technologies to recover from the crisis. even before covid-19, clients who had established sophisticated trust and risk management infrastructures capable of responding dynamically were the ones thriving. it is these organizations that are likely to navigate through the recovery in better shape. variations on the road to recovery many industries will be forever changed by the shift to digital modes of operating that were established during covid-19. kpmg's assessment of covid-19 on global market signals reveals enduring impacts beyond the initial response on ways of working, digital commerce, supply chain and manufacturing, labor force, and more.as companies work to reestablish worried about survival. preserving cash

chain.uncertainty threatens current investments since covid-19 has upended business as usual, many companies need to accelerate their use of emerging technologies faster than ever before. yet they are simultaneously dealing with an unparalleled level of uncertainty across the business landscape. looming over everything is fear of new spikes in case numbers. some industries, such as airlines, hotels, restaurants and brick-and-mortar retail, are in especially precarious positions. anticipating permanently lowered demand for offerings and with insufficient capital to ride out an extended recession, these industries will need to make a hard reset to recover. other industries, such as travel, industrial manufacturing, insurance and real estate, also face a slow recovery that is dependent on reserves of capital to transform operating models in line with changed customer priorities.traditional digital transformation has always been correlated with more investment. now industries that were most susceptible to covid-19 risks must do the opposite: capitalize on emerging technology without increasing budgets, and at a pace and scale that is much faster than their usual timeline.despite the burning platform for new technology, many enterprises are struggling to find dollars to invest in digital transformation. average investments in emerging technologies have been slashed by millions of dollars across industries and company sizes. approximately 4 in 10 executives say they will halt investment in emerging technology as a result of covid-19. only 13 percent expect to significantly increase investments. as cash becomes increasingly critical for survival, companies are turning to the classic recession tactic of instant budget myopia. the need to generate and preserve liquidity is causing organizations to pull back or delay certain emerging technology projects in order to meet immediate financial objectives in the pandemic's wake.13% only say their organization will invest significantly more in emerging technologies as a result of covid-19. for those industries facing crisis, managing the transition to a digital business model is imperative. however, doing so is made more complicated in a time where investments are critical, but cash must be preserved. emerging technologies and new ways of working will play a significant role in the transformation to a more digital economy, helping companies serve their customers even better than before, keep remote workforces connected, ensure their business is resilient and prepared for disruptions, and build a strong foundation for future product and service innovation. cliff justice, global lead for intelligent automation, and u.s. lead for digital capabilities, expect companies to be more selective in terms of where they invest in emerging technology because the stakes are higher now. understanding what is possible versus what is not, and when and where to use new technology to drive tangible value, are the key decision points. oleg brodski, partner, head of lighthouse, kpmg in germany came together to innovate solutions to these truly unprecedented challenges. companies explored a lot of ideas: some good, some bad, some realistic, some unrealistic. now we are seeing a return to a more pragmatic approach to technology adoption.tim denley, partner in charge of solutions for kpmg in japan, is also seeing smaller and more focused emerging technology investments. c-suites and boards are working to optimize the investment portfolio to focus only on projects that will bring real and immediate value.according to paul henninger, partner and head of lighthouse for kpmg in the u.k., in many cases, emerging technology proposals are being subjected to greater scrutiny as enterprises cope with immediate financial challenges and prepare for recession. only investments with crystal-clear goals, laser-focused adoption and deployment plans, and rich return potential are likely to be approved. the transition from covid-19 response to recovery has initiated a slight return to caution, henninger says. when the crisis began, new technology ideas proliferated as people spending intentions delayed, but many expect to spending intentions pushed out, but many expect to increase within next 12 months how do you anticipate covid-19 to impact spending in the next 12 months?how do you anticipate covid-19 to impact spending in the next 12 months?44% of executives expect to increase spending on 5g in the next 12 months, while 26% expect to decrease it. a similar story for process automation, with 43% of executives expecting to increase spending and 25% expecting to decrease.given this shift in perspective, it makes sense that organizations that have been able to scale up emerging technology initiatives despite the challenges are now focused on longer-term objectives, such as company valuation, brand recognition, and topline growth, as opposed to traditional productivity and efficiency measures. the pandemic has driven a huge change in the perspective and focus around technology, says denley. for the most part, it's helping refocus efforts in the places that will have the most value. enterprises are doubling down and even accelerating investments in core technologies such as cloud, ai, and automation given the uncertainty of the environment right now.average investments in emerging technologies have declined across industry and company size.across industry what is your current level of investment for these emerging technologies in your organization (or business unit)what is your current level of investment for these emerging technologies in your organization (or business unit)?and the good news is that all recessions eventually end. for most emerging technologies, investment plans have not disappeared for good, but have been pushed to the future. our research indicates that over the next 12 months, some emerging technology spend is expected to grow, with a focus on ai, 5g, automation, and cloud technologies. key insight: the industries most impacted by covid-19 - airlines, hotels, restaurants, retail - realize they need to boldly seek new solutions, and have only nominally reduced emerging tech spend during the pandemic. an airline executive told us about his company's need to fast track airport remodeling. a retail executive stressed the importance of rapidly expanding his company's virtual presence. since the shutdown, we've also seen how logistics companies have become more essential, playing a critical role in transporting supplies and keeping commerce moving. investment clarity found although some new technology spending is temporarily frozen in some sectors, our research shows that the pandemic is increasing investment clarity. budget pressures and operating model stressors are forcing organizations to prioritize areas that bring important near-term benefits over technology in"
3rd-Party - Software is Transforming the Automotive World (Jun-20).pdf,"As automakers move to vehicle computing architectures that are more centralized, modular, connected and reusable, there are attractive market opportunities for software companies. However four major obstacles remain: 1) Quality requirements demand huge validation efforts, 2) Value-based pricing of SW is at odds with many OEM legacy pricing strategies, 3) A lack of standards along the software value chain complicate collaboration, and 4) substantial upfront investment is required. The key for software companies to focus on the areas of strategic importance for the OEMs, but where they don���t yet have the in-house capabilities to meet those needs.","software is transforming the automotive world four strategic options for pure-play software companies merging into the automotive lane part of a Deloitte series on autonomous driving Deloitte's global automotive team helps automotive companies execute innovative ideas in exceptional ways. we offer a global, integrated approach combined with business and industry knowledge to help our clients excel anywhere in the world. our experts work with companies across the entire automotive value chain 2013 OEMs, suppliers, dealerships, logistics, and captive finance providers 2013 to address the full range of challenges the industry must confront.the future of mobility promises nothing short of seamless, automated, personalized travel on demand. various elements of the extended auto-motive ecosystem are combining to realise that dream sooner than expected, meaning that incumbents and newcomers to the automotive industry need to move at top speed. deloitte's future of mobility series (e.g., the future of mobility: what's next? and forces of change: the future of mobility) has laid the groundwork for a discussion of the broader impact of future mobility solutions on industry, government, society and connected stakeholders. with this technically oriented article, we address an emerging group in this land-scape: pure-play software (software-only) companies, which gain importance with every new product or process that incorporates software; automotive solutions are firmly part of this equation. reinventing the wheel: new architecture and platform strategies vehicle developers today face obvious challenges in terms of technological advancement, but longstanding obstacles are also presenting new problems. on-board processing power and data flow capacity need to increase massively, mostly to process data from advanced driver assistance systems (adas), in-vehicle infotainment (ivi) and information systems (such as head-up displays), as well as manage battery and energy levels. but as automated driving functionality ascends even further (level 3 and higher, as shown in figure 1), this processing workload will demand even more. near-universal connectivity in future mobility scenarios will require vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud services with minimal latency. additionally, this connectivity must show vigilance concerning cyber-security threats. when silicon valley's major technology companies entered automotive markets, they instilled the concept of a software-driven electric and electronic (e/e) vehicle architecture into the automotive industry significantly affecting the strategic agenda of traditional original equipment manufacturers (oems). industry titans announced that future market differentiators would be software-driven product and service innovations. autonomous driving is one of the most prominent examples of advanced software development and a key enabler for radical change in the mobility ecosystem.however, there are a few challenges presented by the ever-evolving arena of autonomous driving, which this article breaks down into four categories. by confronting these pain points, pure-play software companies can deftly position themselves in the automotive industry supply chain, helping steer the e/e revolution. consequently, a new type of electronic architecture is evolving: from distributed function-specific electronic control units (ecus) to a handful of domain-specific control units (dcus) and as the target-state vision to only one central, or a few zone-oriented, domain-independent vehicle computers (vcs) with cloud connectivity (figure 2). near-universal connectivity in future mobility scenarios will require vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud services with minimal latency.software is transforming the automotive world four strategic options for pure-play software companies merging into the automotive lane driver completely in charge of lateral control driver is in monitoring mode at all times vehicle in charge of lateral and longitudinal control in specific situations vehicle takes over other tasks driverless during defined use cases vehicle in charge of lateral and longitudinal control in many situations; minimized risk of accidents vehicle in charge of lateral and longitudinal control in all situations; according to use case, no steering wheel and/or pedal required driver needs to be ready to take over as a backup system vehicle in charge of lateral and longitudinal control in many situations; warns driver in a timely manner.one might think that establishing such integrated platform architectures should encourage the re-use of software applications. consider the analogy of a personal computing application: a photo editor is developed, tested, verified and validated once, but deployed many times on various hardware configurations (such as an individual's home pc, or over the cloud), based on well-defined standard interfaces. now consider conventional distributed e/e architectures this simple concept can't be applied in that case because each application is developed as a monolithic, embedded system. it works in the vehicle it was designed for but can't be reused in another vehicle or domain without major rework. regardless of this limitation, developers can't deny the advantages of reusing software, and they persist in their efforts to standardize platforms to:enable application development that is independent of the start of production (sop) provide software updates over-the-air (ota) and thus de-couple application/platform improvements from expensive physical recalls during a vehicle's life cycle  increase scalability by standardising hardware components that no longer feature oem-specific hardware characteristics .software is transforming the automotive world potentially open up application development to third parties with strong software-engineering expertise but no previous automotive hardware experience. the shifting gears of oem requirements and value-chain dynamics establishing standardised platforms lead to gradually replacing classic components that feature function-specific, embedded, monolithic software. instead, more separated hardware and software development modes are ideal ones that are clearly defined by standard interfaces allowing for easy integration, similar to a plug-and-play approach. platform concepts, derived from silicon valley- inspired consumer electronics and software system architectures, are being introduced by oems, tier-1 companies and other key players in the automotive e/e field. potential new players can look to these concepts for an idea of where to tap into new business opportunities in the future (figure 3). the last aspect, in particular, leads us back to our initial question about whether developments will open up opportunities for pure-play software companies in the automotive industry. some oems and large automotive tier-1 suppliers have already outlined their thoughts on this point, as described in the next section. the demand for software expertise is growing, but there is a general shortage of capabilities and people with the right skill sets, both in-house and externally, which reveals strong potential points of entry for pure-play software companies.demand for software expertise is growing, but there is a general shortage of capabilities and people with the right skill sets.with their traditionally dominant role in the value chain, automotive oems are

automotive lane according to thomas m. mcller, executive vice-president of r&d for volkswagen china and former head of development for electrics/electronics and car-it at audi, they're aiming to : 2022 bundle oem-specific functional characteristics from formerly separated ecus as differentiators on the dcu level or (in future vehicle generations) vc level 2022 avoid sourcing black-box embedded systems, by which responsibility for hardware development and software integration stays exclusively with tier-1 suppliers generic hardware components (such as sensors or actuators) separately from differentiating features get actively involved in chip selection, considering strong recent efforts from semiconductor producers to provide systems on a chip (soc)  develop new capabilities of classic tier-1 suppliers to transition them from black-box system providers into overall integrators (while still bearing overall product liability for the system) establish more oem-proprietary, in-house capabilities in the fields of application software, functions and services, as well as semiconductor know-how in parallel, strengthen working models and commercial models with specialised software suppliers and software developers. this is how (some) oems plan to make the smart-phone on wheels a reality with the help of their value-chain partners, and there does seem to be real automotive business opportunities for software specialists. however, in deloitte's experience, and given our knowledge of the automotive value chain, there are still a few significant obstacles to be overcome before achieving vibrant, sustainable, software-only markets in the automotive industry. the four challenges pure-play software companies must negotiate the automotive market is still a tough one for software specialists; many market practices seem to be potential roadblocks for pure-play software companies, standing in the way of attractive and vibrant market opportunities. but keep this in mind: passenger vehicles already use four times as many lines of code as commercial aircrafts which is going to increase by a factor of 10,000 in the next few years.oems can neither master the giant task of complex embedded software development posed by autonomous driving alone, nor rely on the handful of large tier-1 suppliers holding strong market positions as integrated system suppliers. bear that in mind as we examine the following roadblocks, then delve into strategic options to overcome them. quality and safety requirements demanding huge verification and validation effort strict automotive quality standards take into account that the life cycle of a vehicle is significantly longer than that of, say, a smartphone. what's more, the vehicle's systems must be reliable in much more challenging conditions (such as being exposed to weather), and stringent functional safety requirements apply, as outlined in iso standard . a great number of software-supported vehicle functions occur frequently (e.g., braking) or are hard to control (e.g., emergency braking on an icy road) and can result in severe incidents, such as passenger injuries; they must be precisely engineered. asil risk classifications dictate software safety requirements with which oems and suppliers must comply. in our experience, the cost of integration, testing, verifying and validating functions to meet these requirements can easily amount to 40 percent, or more, of overall development budgets (from the start of development to the start of production).software is transforming the automotive world four strategic options for pure-play software companies merging into the automotive lane upcoming regulations targeting cyber-security risk management (for example, the unece wp.297) add to the already high requirements; from 2021, oems will be required to have certified cyber-security management systems (csms) and software update management systems (sums). to name a few of the necessary actions for oems: they will have to ensure that suppliers provide detailed product descriptions for installed software, from product development to the end of the vehicle's lifetime, as well as proactive software updates and patches to ensure information security. such industry specific, regulation-driven requirements pose high entry barriers for new automotive software suppliers. oem-imposed prerequisites for supplier qualification are very strict. and once qualified, after a long period marked by significant supplier effort and investment, dependency on the newly won oem customer is almost inevitable, as is the grudging acceptance of more and more commercial control imposed by the oem. 2. no clear visibility of software value in a vehicle's bill of material in traditional distributed e/e architectures, procurement of software embedded in hardware systems can be measured in cost per piece in the bill of material. the cost of software is not intuitively measurable, nor is its value, by piece or even by vehicle. typical automotive pricing works from the bottom up , as it ensures commercial measurable cost control and strong calculation negotiation position parameters as starting point .traditional automotive standard, based on transparent cost calculation plus markup price positions per piece; a mark-up (margin) is finally added on top of that. from an oem perspective, this has clear advantages namely, commercial control and a strong negotiation position. the typical software pricing approach in other industries, such as consumer electronics, works from the top down with a value-based pricing strategy. the price derives from the customers2019 willingness to pay for the product or feature. this requires software developers to retain intellectual property or risk endangering their competitive advantage, value proposition and business model. it is exactly this aspect that stands at odds with many oem strategies: oems generally view features pertaining to driving dynamics (e.g., driving assistance or autonomous driving) as strategic core areas and key differentiators. ivi solutions or digital maps, on the other hand, are generally seen as commodities. the alternative for pure-play software companies is to act as development partners to oems or large tier-1 suppliers, based on hourly fees. although this is an easy opportunity to generate business, it is no different from traditional business models of engineering service providers, and presents pure-play software companies with little to no potential for additional business advantage. it's more lucrative to focus on higher-margin adas feature development, as elaborated in the next section.customers willingness to pay as starting point typical approach for software pricing in other industries (consumer electronics) or domains (infotainment, maps). the substantial upfront investment, lengthy amortization strong financial stamina is required as an automotive software supplier, given oem procurement regulations and practices leftover from the days of embedded software procurement. software development costs are often considered upfront supplier investments, only compensated along the product life cycle as part of the unit price (figure 5). this puts suppliers at significant financial risk, considering that volume developments may end up lower than initially forecasted. amortization periods of five years are common and a heavy burden for small and mid-sized suppliers. far-reaching product liability commitments are an additional factor to consider. in the past, black-box embedded systems from tier-1 suppliers were accepted by oems for  among other reasons clear liability for products. in other words, somebody had to be the first in line for oems to claim money back in case of quality or functional failures. this requires deep pockets, as well as overall vehicle integration and legal expertise. lack of collaboration standards along the software value chain oems, traditional tier-1 suppliers, new soft-ware-focused market entrants, engineering service providers and even semiconductor manufacturers they're all pushing to market services and products that involve vehicle software development. frustratingly, all potential customers of a pure-play software company, mainly oems or large tier-1 companies, are following different strategies when it comes to application software. some are developing in-house talent and capabilities (for example, bmw's car-it and, more recently, volkswagen's car.software.org8). some are entering long-term partnerships or joint ventures with application software specialists (consider e.solutions, an audi-elektrobit joint venture). still others are engaging in classic outsourcing, calling on engineering service providers for software development tasks while the oems retain intellectual property of the produced source code. roles in the auto-motive software value chain remain highly fluid. figure 5illustrative project calculation of automotive suppliers for embedded systems product line 1remark: additional amortization contributions are realized through additional sales

year software is transforming the automotive world to attract software-only players, more stability of automotive stakeholder roles is needed, and predictability of what automotive software customers require. for this purpose, standardising platform concepts for easier (third-party) software integration is crucial, as is establishing industry-wide collaboration models and technology interfaces to bring oems, suppliers, pure-play software companies and other automotive players closer together. efforts in this direction so far have included autosar classic and autosar adaptive platforms, and are driven mostly by european oems and tier-1 suppliers.without more actions that encourage stability and predictability, the only feasible commercial model for pure-play software companies 2013 outside the aforementioned long-term partnerships 2013 comprise service contracts directly determined by hourly development effort. but this model provides little incentive for software experts to invest time and money in new automotive-specific solutions. this is especially true if they are used to consumer electronics markets, which are far less regulated and not as commercially dominated by a small number of potential business-to-business customers. the automotive industry is largely aware of its challenges, and traditional players (the potential clients of pure-play software companies) are

in-vehicle software development, which is in all players2019 interests. the same applies to achieving standardised hardware-software interfaces and interfaces within the software stack, which will, in turn, help cut verification costs by facilitating software re-use. apart from being involved in industry-wide initiatives for establishing standards, alongside oems (such as autosar, as mentioned above), large tier-1 suppliers are embracing the role of system integrators by providing joint software development and integration platforms.oems, for their part, are also working on new processes and commercial models to extend traditional oem-supplier relationships and make it easier for pure-play software companies to deliver their value contribution.10and that takes us back to our initial question: what are the sweet spots along the automotive software value chain for pure-play software companies? the answer is best derived from understanding their potential clients needs for the sake of clarity, we'll focus on oems.  four strategic options for pure-play software companies merging into the automotive lane figure 6strategic option framework for automotive pure-play software companies strategic value/differentiator for oemhgihcapability development: acquire missing capabilities quickly and secure intellectual property of code for market differentiation software co: consider joint ventures or other strategic partnerships ensuring profit-sharing business model with oems commodity oem. software solutions for competitive prices software co: provide products and solutions, preferably along (e.g., per-vehicle) license pricing model score business oem: stabilise in-house organisation, optimise performance and efficiency (along processes, systems, tools, etc.) or seek partnerships for network effects software co: help customer (re-)organise and optimise their operations (service-based or by offering development tools, etc.) or discuss partnerships2018low-hanging fruit2019oem: seek opportunities to outsource tasks that add less value and re-allocate internal capabilities software co: help customer 2018extend their workbench2019 by acting as software development service provider (on a time-and-material basis)follow  own capabilities (status quo)core business (high strategic value and high oem capabilities): typically service-based (for performance improvement of software development operations) or license-based (for development tools). on the other hand, the prospect of network effects (e.g., a product's value increases with the number of users) can lead to attractive options for partnership with oems. examples include a software company offering access to its consumer electronics customer base, to enhance the reach of an oem's mobility services or ivi applications. software companies should strive to identify such potential network effects, especially considering their typically much larger private customer base and oems2019 relatively small fleet sizes (such as for the quality of traffic information or object detection). potential automotive clients of pure-play software companies have already undertaken significant efforts to build their software competency in highly relevant domains. well-publicized examples can be found in the area of autonomous driving, where many major oems have invested enormous resources to build in-house capabilities in recent years. but it's not too late to find attractive entry points for pure-play software companies. on the one hand, pure-play software companies can share best practices for effective organisation design, drive performance in agile development settings or offer operational tools for software development adapted to automotive needs. such business models are 10software is transforming the automotive world a key advantage for pure-play software companies in this regard is that, in many cases, necessary investments in automotive-specific product adaptations are not too high. other advantages include the possibility to retain intellectual property, not hand over one's unique value proposition to the oem and be able to capture a potential business advantage in a vehicle's life cycle, by monetizing data or via software licenses.capability development (high strategic value and low oem capabilities):potential automotive clients have an urgent need to build new capabilities quickly, ensuring future vehicles remain attractive and unique in their markets. this is generally a favorable situation for pure-play software companies with the necessary skills and assets. strategic partnerships, joint ventures and even company takeovers are highly common, spurred by oems desire to grow crucial new software development capabilities in house, and by the lack of standard hardware-software interfaces in the industry. to name just a couple of examples: volkswagen's acquisitions of a wire-less car (a telematics specialist)12 and argo ai (an autonomous vehicle platform) with ford.13however, not only large, industry-shaping partnerships fall under this category. technology scouting among smaller, even start-up2013stage software companies has become a standard process for many oems.14 in this context, what pure-play software companies should remember is the benefit of profit-sharing business models. 2018low hanging fruit2019 (low strategic value and high oem capabilities): potential automotive clients are seeking opportunities to increase the flexibility of their workforce (growing without hiring new internal employees) or to gradually reduce using their resources for tasks that add little value. in this industry, this has traditionally meant a large market for engineering service providers, and oems will require even more support in the future, such as for testing, verification and validation of software, or for coding tasks at the oem's instruction (with the oem retaining the intellectual property).11new pure-play software companies have the chance to secure the low-hanging fruit of this market with their well-trained and substantial software development talent 2013 especially while traditional engineering service providers struggle to build size and capability in relevant areas. however, as mentioned above, such time-and-material2013based business models might offer a scant business advantage as compared to, for example, business-to-consumer ventures, in which development resources might be allocated more profitably. commodity (low strategic value and low oem capabilities): potential automotive clients seek to source standard vehicle software products or services but don2019t regard these commodities as differentiating features for car customers. examples (naturally, oem specific) may include software for payment services, for subscription management, or weather, news or real-time traffic information. pricing such essentially 2018off-the-shelf2019 software and data products would preferably follow license-based models: the use of proprietary code or data is remunerated per vehicle, user or amount of data transmitted. 11 four strategic options for pure-play software companies merging into the automotive lane considering all the above pathways for entry to the automotive industries, there remains no question about the existence of business opportunities for pure-play software companies. the race for future business claims is not yet decided, but automotive software markets are tough to thrive in, especially with missing architecture and interface standards. it's worth participating early and actively in efforts to support shaping these future standards before consolidation and standardization activities shut the barriers to market entry. traditional automotive giants will not be able to achieve the transition to becoming data-driven technology companies by themselves, meaning their future success in furthering technology integration could very well lie in the hands of pure-play software companies. and the success of those pure-play companies will, in turn, depend on how well they can surmount the four major challenges described above. however, this is a trend affecting not just the automotive industry. insurance, healthcare, energy, media, and manufacturing in general are among the others going through their own digital transformations, which naturally brings the need for increased software capabilities. as software 201cis eating the world201d,15 pure-play software companies find themselves on an upward trajectory with significant growth potential. still, there are fundamental challenges similar to those in the automotive industry: coping with entry barriers in highly competitive markets and finding the right spot in established supply chains and business models. obstacles aside, the future looks bright for pure-play software companies that have the right mindset and an adaptive business approach. now if all industry leaders can identify their own software capability shortcomings and actively work on solutions that leverage the potential of pure-play companies, both sides will enjoy a win-win situation.12software is transforming the automotive world."
3rd-Party - Startup Funding in Logistics for Last Mile Delivery (May-20).pdf,"Low profit margins have made it difficult for logistics businesses to experiment with new technologies, so much so that 50% of the largest U.S. importers still use spreadsheets to manage their international supply chains. However, a new generation of logistics startups are aiming to solve these issues, backed by venture capital firms. About $28B has been invested since 2015. Growth is now driven by startups working on last-mile and freight platforms  Instacart, Flexport  that have reached maturity and are receiving larger funding rounds.","startup funding in logistics new money for an old industry?startup funding in logistics and freight transportation a tale of inefficiencies and gradual improvements the transport and logistics sector has seen marked improvements in recent decades, despite its history of coping with inefficiencies. fundamental efficiency increases have typically been linked to new technologies and applications entering the market, such as the introduction of containers and pallets. along with the facilitated handling of goods, came an explosion in trade volumes, and the resulting economies of scale brought costs down. as transport and logistics became more efficient, prices decreased (exhibit 1).the industry is undeniably under constant pressure to lower cost development of transport costs at real rates.startup funding in logistics 50%of us largest importers still use spreadsheets to manage their complex international supply chain the analysis focuses on startups that provide logistics services logistics is defined as the outsourced movement or storage of goods and includes warehousing and storage, parcel delivery, trucking, freight shipping, rail cargo, and air cargo. the sample includes companies active in the delivery of groceries but excludes startups in the area of delivering prepared food (e.g., delivery hero), as these logistics services are traditionally insourced. despite all this progress, inefficiencies are still far from being eradicated. in fact, they are prevalent everywhere you look in the industry. a high number of breakpoints (e.g., a normal cross-country trade has to go through more than ten parties, each of which has multiple touchpoints; dwell time in container yards can exceed five days), complex pricing rules, intuition-based decision making, and little data standardization present significant challenges in the industry. shippers and consignees need to interact with up to 25 different entities (customs, terminals, shipping lines, forwarders, authorities, etc.). a typical door-to-door spot freight quote contains more than 20 line items. 50 percent of the us2019 largest importers still use spreadsheets to manage their complex international supply chain. these are only a few examples of the many inefficiencies that the industry continues to face. the complexity of the industry's landscape and its operations has prevented the development of quick-fix solutions to these inefficiencies. furthermore, a high degree of market fragmentation, partly into micro-businesses (e.g., mom-and-pop truckers, delivery drivers, independent freight brokers) means fierce competition. combined with a lack of transparency, this keeps prices down and has even forced the industry to operate below a break-even point in certain years and not earn its cost of capital during some cycles. this is illustrated in more detail in the recently published report 201cpathway to value creation in transport and logistics.201d1 in fact, logistics costs as a share of gdp have decreased by 1 to 7 percentage points over recent decades. developed countries, such as germany, switzerland, or the us, could reduce logistics costs as a share of gdp by about 1 percentage point, while some emerging markets, such as malaysia, taiwan, or the uae have reached a reduction as high as 7 percentage points from their previously higher base. low profitability has made it difficult for the industry to experiment with fundamentally new solutions it's hard to reinvent yourself when you're struggling to maintain profits quarter after quarter. the comparatively low and continuously decreasing prices (in real terms) have also kept the industry's customers relatively quiet increasing customer expectations and direct pressure from the consumer that have led to changes in many other industries (travel, retail, mobility, and others) have been largely absent until recently in a traditional, b2b-shaped industry. today's incumbent logistics companies have only gradually adapted to new technologies. requirements for flawless execution, operational efficiencies amid complexity, and low margins have prevented them from testing radical solutions on existing issues and shielded them from the first wave of disruptive startup activity seen in other sectors with the advent of the internet. vessels have become bigger and equipped with more and more technology, but the basic operating model has stayed the same. the concept of asset-light third-party logistics providers as supply chain orchestrators was born in the 1970s, and to this day, kchne + nagel, dhl, and traditional family enterprises like fiege are still the key players in freight forwarding and contract logistics.as incumbent logistics companies are often too rigid to bring about drastic changes, a new generation of logistics startups, backed by investors with deep pockets, aims to solve some of the industry's oldest issues and address entirely new and rapidly growing market needs. in this article, recent funding trends in the logistics industry are analyzed, and a perspective is derived on the implications for incumbent logistics companies, logistics startups, and investors. funding in logistics > 90%of total startup funding in logistics to date has been analyzed (usd 26 billion, 120 startups)more than 120 of the biggest logistics startups were analyzed; they are seven years old on average and represent an estimated 93 percent (approximately usd 26 billion) of total startup funding in logistics to date. most of this funding comes from early- and late-stage venture capital, but a few mature startups have raised money from private equity or through corporate rounds. interestingly, only one company in the sample has gone public as of the time of this publication. hangzhou-based unicorn best inc. (nyse:best) provides a wide range of logistics services and had its ipo in september 2017, raising usd 450 million. the company is backed by online retail giant alibaba and predominantly offers traditional logistics services, such as less-than-truckload services, express delivery, and cross-border door-to-door services (from and to china). the company also offers a bidding platform that allows users to source truck capacity and complements these services with its proprietary tech platform as well as retail and finance services. the sample includes companies that are focused exclusively on logistics. diversified startups with the majority of their business in non-logistics segments are not part of the sample (e.g., uber or gojek. although uber freight and gojek are engaged in logistics, their main product remains the passenger mobility platform; since uber raised well over usd 24 billion and gojek well over usd 3 billion, including these would significantly distort the picture due to the big proportion of non-logistics activities).total funding in logistics startups has seen a dramatic increase over the last few years.the growth story is no longer fueled by more funding rounds; instead, it is fueled by startups reaching maturity and receiving larger funding rounds venture capital discovered the logistics industry in 2015 seeing an enormous market that is growing and is poised for disruption given the vast inefficiencies, the venture capital industry has increasingly cast an eye on startups in the logistics industry. around usd 28 billion has been invested, almost all of which was raised in 2015 or later. neeraj bharadwaj, managing director of the carlyle asia buyout team, explains the interest as follows: we see significant potential for technology-enabled logistics in the country with the growth of e-commerce as well as increasing customer focus on on-time delivery and service levels. this comment was made after the announcement of carlyle's investment in delhivery. exhibit 2 shows that the number of reported deals involving the companies from our sample was stagnant from 2016 to 2018 and even dropped in 2019, while the average deal size and thus total funding grew threefold over the same period. therefore, the growth story is no longer fueled by more funding rounds; instead, it is fueled by startups reaching maturity and receiving larger funding rounds.2019 began with strong tailwind in q1. highlights include the usd 1 billion round from flexport, a us-based digital freight forwarder. however, the rest of the year saw a significant slowdown compared to the boom in 2018. nonetheless, funding is much higher compared to the years before 2018. funding volume growth in logistics startups has outpaced overall venture growth venture funding growth in logistics compared to overall venture growth indexed growth.overall venture funding growth startup funding in logistics funding is highly concentrated, and several startups with enormous funding receive just as much funding as the remaining startups combined this follows the pattern of the overall venture capital industry. stories of failed ipos and internal turmoil in startups have led investors to become more cautious with their money; so 2019, while much higher than the years before, didn't break venture capital's record year in 2018 (see exhibit 3).even when excluding private equity and corporate rounds, logistics funding in 2019 grew 17-fold compared to 2014 and has therefore clearly outgrown overall venture funding across all industries, which has 201conly201d doubled since 2014 (see exhibit 3). while only around usd 375 million was raised in 2014, usd 6.3 billion was invested in logistics startups in 2019. similar to other industries, funding is highly concentrated, and several startups with enormous funding receive just as much funding as the remaining startups combined. consequently, the ten best-funded companies have received about 46 percent of total funding, and the top 20 have accounted for around 66 percent of total funding (see exhibit 4).most funding goes to startups working on last-mile and freight platforms ; instacart, manbang, and flex port .this significant rise in funding begs the question: where does all this money go, and what are the trends getting investors so excited about this industry? (see exhibit 5 and exhibit 6).the top 20 startups have received 66% of total funding the top 10 startups have received 46% of total funding.startups ranked by funding received 120 startup funding in logistics .startups were assigned to 11 distinct business models challenging 4 traditional industry segments: the last-mile delivery category has received far more funding than other segments traditional industry.startup business model new last-mile delivery models road freight marketplaces and solutions description offer innovative last-mile delivery services to retailers and individuals

better forecasts, optimize replenishment, or increase pricing transparency develop distributed-ledger technology to enhance transparency and security note: cep = courier, express, and parcelsource. startups in the cep market have attracted the most funding, despite a smaller addressable market traditional market size usd billions, venture capital's favorite most funding, around usd 11.1 billion, was raised by startups offering last-mile delivery services to retailers and individuals 2013 a venture capital bet that was analyzed in detail in 2017.3 this last-mile segment benefits from the growth in their addressable market, e-commerce logistics (8 to 9 percent cagr from 2017 to 2023). most of the analyzed last-mile startups rely on unconventional delivery modes, e.g., using crowdsourced delivery, drones, avs, and parcel lockers. as they make up usd 9.9 billion of the 11.1 billion, these are more successful in raising funds when compared to their peers relying on a more traditional fleet. companies like nuro inc. and hive box are major attractions for investors in this category and benefit from the hype around their unconventional delivery modes as they anticipate the next normal in last-mile parcel delivery.4nuro designs, manufactures, and operates delivery robots. their robot is being piloted in houston, texas, and scottsdale, arizona. currently, nuro works together with retailer kroger to deliver groceries for a fee. the california-based company's series b brought in usd 940 million in february 2019 and was led by softbank's vision fund.5 hive box, a shenzhen-based startup, was established in 2015 and now operates more than 150,000 parcel lockers located across china, which handle more than 9 million parcels per day. five express companies, including sf express, have a stake in the startup. the company raised usd 323 million in a series b round in january 2018 and currently totals more than usd 700 million in funding. startup funding in logistics freight platforms received the most corporate funding, threatening to replace traditional intermediaries the freight platform market 2013 startups pushing forward, incumbents catching up another segment that has captured a lot of attention and funding is freight platforms. this holds especially true for platforms that focus primarily on road transportation, which have received about usd 6 billion in funding. while the vast majority of this sum comes from investment funds, this segment has also seen the most corporate funding. for example, db schenker acquired a usd 25 million stake in the road freight booking platform uship. these platforms aim to enhance pricing transparency, professionalize, and digitize the often informally handled shipper carrier exchange. they focus on leveraging existing data as a means to address vast inefficiencies that still exist in the market (e.g., caused by empty runs). thus, these startups contribute significantly to improving the sustainability of the transport and logistics industries, a trend that is becoming more prevalent. moreover, the customer experience and ease of use for truckers and customers is compelling. even though the addressable market is gigantic (approximately usd 2.2 trillion for all modes globally), growth is slower, as only 2 to 4 percent cagr is expected from 2017 to 2023.while these road freight marketplaces and solutions have yet to capture large volumes, they have surely challenged asset-lighter brokers and freight forwarders by matching shippers, loads, and carriers directly, thus threatening to replace traditional intermediaries. the emergence of these solutions is pushing the traditional industry toward providing better visibility and more convenience. some incumbent players have already reacted: dhl freight launched the online marketplace saloodo in 2016, and k00fchne + nagel launched freight net, a road freight booking platform, in 2014. transport intelligence revealed that around 10 percent of volumes are shipped or booked through online freight booking platforms, marketplaces, or online forwarders, which include incumbents2019 platforms like freightnet.7 platforms with a similar approach but a focus on air and ocean transport have raised far less than their road transportation peers (usd 1.6 billion). however, flexport, with its strong offering and prominent customer base, clearly dominates this segment and accounts for usd 1.3 billion of the funding. flexport recently announced a partnership with chinese delivery and logistics company sf express to offer customers a one-stop shop for freight services, including robust full container load (fcl) ocean shipping and air cargo. working together, flexport and sf express will connect data and platforms to provide smarter and more advanced logistics services to address the specific needs of chinese companies. incumbents have also reacted in this segment. most prominently, maersk launched its own digital forwarder, twill, in april 2017. the digital shipping platform initially focused on shipments between china and the uk, but quickly expanded and managed to reach 27 countries by the end of 2018. new entrants in the third-party logistics market have also been successful in raising capital. usd 3.3 billion was given to startups developing logistics real estate, such as e-shang redwood, and usd 1.4 billion to asset-based logistics service providers, such as chinese best inc. or us-based blue-grace logistics. these are followed by companies involved in asset tracking (approximately usd 1 billion), specialized e-commerce service providers (approximately usd 640 million), providers of analytics solutions (approximately usd 530 million), inventory and order management solution providers (approximately 530 million), and finally, startups involved in developing blockchain technology for logistics (approximately 160 million).funding in logistics exhibit last-mile and freight platforms have been on the map for a while; tech-enabled asset players in pl market gaining traction traditional industry:tech usd 50 million cep transport storage average annual funding, usd millions segment new last-mile delivery models road freight marketplace and solutions warehousing air and ocean transportation traditional third-party or contract logistics services new entrants in the parcel businessb2b e-commerce specialists intelligence providers inventory/order management asset tracking.startup funding in logistics asset-based logistics service providers are the second-fastest-growing segment looking at investments in these categories over time, warehousing has grown the most when comparing the average yearly funding in the periods of 2010 to 2014 and 2015 to 2019. asset-based logistics service providers are the second-fastest-growing segment, so both rather 201ctraditional201d segments are increasingly popular among investors. while the asset-lighter freight platforms and last-mile delivery companies have collected the most funding, investors seem to increasingly turn back to good old asset-based models revamped with tech capabilities (see exhibit 7).china is ahead of the pack and has taken the lead from the us in recent years, funding has shifted from the us to china. while the us accounted for 54 percent of total funding back in 2014 and only 35 percent in 2019 (cumulative), china accounted for 40 percent in 2019 (cumulative) compared to just 19 percent in 2014. the startup landscape in china is characterized by a high concentration of very large funding rounds: a mere 20 chinese logistics startups were able to collect more than usd 10 billion, while 61 of their us peers were able to collect about usd 9.8 billion (see exhibit 8).exhibit 8the us received the largest amount of funding in  2014 in 2019, chinese startups dominated funding cumulative funding by region. europe takes up a disproportionally small share apac (excl. china and india) with high concentration of very well-funded logistics startups, especially in hong kong and Singapore .the us share dropped significantly, mostly due to the funding frenzy in china. china was able to increase its share ,lack of large funding rounds led china to drop out. 10 of the best-funded logistics startups are from china delivery providers have received lots of attention and funding. another important part of the quote is that the cost for enterprises will be lowered. china has relatively high logistics costs (logistics account for approximately 13 percent of gdp, while developed countries average at approximately 8 percent), and the government has repeatedly expressed its interest in lowering these. the reform fund's stake in man bang shows that supporting startups is one way they intend to do so.furthermore, local governments set up industrial parks and provide infrastructure and capital to create an ecosystem in which entrepreneurs can cooperate and flourish. the government expects this to spur economic growth, foster innovation, and generate tax revenue. the latter seems to be less of a priority; however, venture capital firms have enjoyed a deduction on taxable income by 70 percent of their investment in seed or early-stage high-tech startups since the beginning of 2019. small companies can also qualify for significant tax relief if their income does not exceed rmb 3 million (about usd 435,800).aside from favorable demand growth and high government support, a third factor plays an important role in the success of china's logistics startups: the combination of tech and logistics expertise. this is best observed at the manbang group, which has hired hundreds of people previously employed by logistics players, such as alibaba or logistics incumbents.the concentration in china can also be illustrated this way: six of the top ten best-funded logistics startups are from china, the best-funded of which being the manbang group, an uber-like platform for trucks formed by the merger of yunmanman and huochebang; it received usd 1.9 billion in an enormous private-equity round. manbang has used the funding to acquire logistics talent and acquire its own assets via its integration of zihong logistics. manbang's funding round constitutes the single largest funding round for a logistics startup and was led by softbank's vision fund as well as the china reform fund management, with other investors, including google's capital g, tencent holdings, sequoia capital, and others.china's dominance is driven by a tendency to innovate fast and a willingness to try out novel business models, accelerated by stronger overall economic growth. china has already become one of the greatest incubators of many disruptive digital innovators and is a leading global investor in disruptive technologies. one way to see how this manifests is the tremendous demand growth in e-commerce, which has long moved past tier-one cities.10 the country thus seeks new, efficient, and convenient ways of delivering the ever-increasing number of goods ordered online. previous research shows that the average citizen residing in tier-one cities orders more than 70 parcels per year, on average.the importance of the e-commerce sector for china is also reflected in premier li's internet plus initiative, which aims to boost the integration of logistics and internet technology, lower the cost for enterprises, and make people's lives more convenient. e-commerce does a great deal for the convenience part, and thus last-mile 10 for more information, see: for more information, see: funding in logistics indian market has seen several successful new entrants with traditional business models apac 2013 successful new entrants with traditional business models apac (excluding china) also has a high concentration of very well-funded logistics startups, especially in hong kong, singapore, and india. startups in hong kong benefit from their proximity to large and fast-growing markets in china and southeast asia. for example, e-shang redwood, a logistics real estate developer, has a large portfolio of projects in china and has even expanded into japan, south korea, india, singapore, and australia. similarly, 4px express, which was established in hong kong in 2004, already employs 1,500 people across 50 locations and provides china-focused cross-border e-commerce services to a large number of merchants. the singapore post and shenzhen capital group, government-owned venture capital and private equity investment fund, are among the company's major investors. last-mile startups entering the market with more traditional modes (scooters, vans, trucks) are most successful in asia-pacific, especially in india, where players, such as delhivery and xpressbees, have built a completely new parcel network and collected hundreds of millions in funding within a few years. this shows that the traditional parcel players offerings have not sufficiently addressed these markets.delhivery managed to build a parcel network within a few years after its establishment in 2011 and has thus far collected around usd 935 million in funding. the company moved from providing quick food deliveries to e-commerce fulfillment and has delivered over 550 million shipments thus far. besides operating an express parcel network, the company has 75 fulfillment centers (with more than 4 million square meters of space) across india, their own fleet offering less-than-truckload and full-truckload services, as well as a cross-border network of clearance agents and forwarders. delhivery has also built its own tech capabilities, e.g., through its in-house transport management platform and its freight booking and management interfaces optimus and orio. xpressbees is another indian delivery startup specializing in e-commerce and delivers over 60,000 shipments per day. the company focuses on same- and next-day delivery and has gathered more than usd 160 million in funding (including an investment from alibaba) since their establishment in 2015. bangalore-based digital trucking platform blackbuck has simplified india's trucking market and was able to raise usd 285 million since their founding in 2015. their platform lists 300,000 trucks from 60,000 fleet owners, and the company recently announced a partnership with maersk. funding in logistics of the cumulative logistics startup funding is accounted for in europe only a drop in the ocean the money raised by their asian and us peers has reached levels that european startups can only dream of. europe's logistics startups are funded far less and only account for a 5 percent share of the cumulative logistics startup funding.despite europe's strong presence in the traditional industry, with big names like deutsche post dhl, k00fchne + nagel, dsv, and schenker, european logistics startups cannot keep up with the funding raised in other parts of the world. europe contributes 26 percent to the global gdp, and european-based logistics companies take up almost half of the global top 50 logistics service providers revenues, but the funding that european logistics startups receive is low compared to the us and china (see exhibit 9). funding for logistics startups in europe lags when compared to the overall funding landscape funding in logistics vs. overall venture funding by region percentage of total.  rounds in europe are dwarfed by enormous rounds in us and apac national borders. logistics clusters and tech-startup clusters are seldom colocated, hindering cooperation and knowledge exchange among the two camps. digital startups spawn and flourish in capital cities, such as amsterdam and berlin, but have very little contact with logistics hotspots like hamburg or rotterdam. this might also be a reason why last-mile is such a popular and well-funded segment. urban tech talent is confronted with rapid urban e-commerce delivery more frequently than with the drier issues of warehouse process optimization or port and airport operations to process long-haul shipments, usually located outside of cities.the analyzed funding is creating substantial opportunities for startups to drive innovation in the sector. it is enabling young companies to compete with incumbents and will challenge the status quo over the next decade. in the following section, the implications for incumbents, startups, and investors are analyzed, and key hypotheses are presented. apparently, neither the local incumbents nor local investor communities believe in the opportunity of tech-enabled logistics startups to the extent that chinese and us investors do. what is considered significant and makes headlines in europe, such as last year's highlights, including zencargo's usd 20 million round in april, freighthub's usd 30 million in may, or even sennder's usd 70 million in july, is dwarfed by rounds worth hundreds of millions in asia and the us. one part of the explanation is that venture funding just isn2019t as common in europe as it is in silicon valley or shenzhen. however, the overall venture capital funding share of europe (across all industries) was at about 15 percent in 2018, so the 5 percent share of the cumulative logistics startup funding still seems very small.one significant barrier for the european logistics startups is the established shippers, such as traditional manufacturing companies, which have relied on incumbent services for decades."

HERE MI analyzed and derived these key findings:  1% of AWS customers are enterprise (defined as 1,000 employees or more) or an estimated 11900 companies; 5% of Microsoft Azure or 7700 companies; 0.7% of Google Cloud Platform or 3000 companies; 3% of Digital Ocean or 1875 companies, and 0.5% of Alibaba Cloud or 1,250 companies. MI estimates that roughly 25% of AWS revenues came from enterprise customers in 2019, up from 15% in 2014. There are ~325K companies who spend >$120K a year on public cloud, but only 14,500 of them are enterprise. The takeaway being the majority of companies that spend big on public cloud providers like AWS, Azure and GCP have less than 1,000 employees. ","global cloud hosting market in 2020 despite increasing volatility in today's global economic landscape, according to intricately's analysis, 2020 remains on pace for another record year of cloud application growth. the cloud hosting market remains high-growth and competitive, particularly among top players google cloud provider (gcp), microsoft azure, and amazon web services (aws). the number of cloud applications in use grew by 39% in 2019, up from 36% in 2018, according to intricately's analysis.the public cloud market shows no signs of slowing down, with continued growth and competition among the largest providers. gartner forecasts that worldwide public cloud service revenue will surpass $266 billion in 2020. (source) how did the cloud hosting market fare in 2019, and what changes can we expect in 2020 and beyond? keep reading to learn our cloud predictions for 2020. how fast is cloud application usage growing?total number of cloud applications in use since 2015 who is winning in the cloud hosting market? how do amazon web services, microsoft azure, and google cloud platform stack up against one another? what regions are experiencing the most cloud growth? how much do companies spend on cloud hosting around the world?37 million companies evaluated21,000 unique products monitored our data is trusted by:methodology to gather the data and supporting evidence for this report, we analyzed historical data from january 2013 to december 2019 on cloud hosting environments and providers worldwide. the data in this report is collected from intricately's proprietary global sensor network, which provides real-time cloud usage and spend data.intricately monitors the adoption, usage, and spend on 21,000 distinct cloud products and analyzes the digital infrastructure of more than seven million companies worldwide. using its global sensor network, deployed in more than 150 points of presence (pops), intricately has a comprehensive view into how organizations deploy, utilize, and invest in their digital products, applications, and ecosystems intricately come to learn more about our platform.aws dominates the cloud hosting market which cloud hosting platform is winning with customers?aws customer count compared to microsoft azure and gcp customer count aws is growing revenue more than twice as fast as the distant second place competitor, microsoft azure. aws reported $9.95 billion in cloud revenue in the last quarter of 2019. (source)it will be challenging to compare aws and any other competitor for the foreseeable future. the closest competitors are microsoft azure and google cloud platform (gcp).the functionality gap is widening and we're about 24 months ahead. microsoft and google are betting on saas to drive cloud utilization how much do microsoft and google's saas products impact cloud revenue? microsoft and gcp customer count with saas products vs. aws saas iaas and paas. both microsoft and gcp deploy low-cost saas solutions with the hopes it will lead to stickier, higher-margin iaas and paas. according to reports, google cloud generated $2.61 billion for the quarter, but that number includes revenue from both gcp and g suite. meanwhile, microsoft reported $12.5 billion in combined cloud revenue, which includes saas (office 365, dynamics, etc.) and cloud computing (microsoft azure). in the same calendar quarter, aws surpassed gcp's quarterly cloud revenue nearly five times with its iaas and paas products alone. amazon reported just under $10 billion in cloud revenue, putting them far ahead of google and microsoft for cloud hosting market share.we're growing at a meaningfully more significant absolute dollar rate than anybody else, even at a much larger absolute size. it's clear that the growth of iaas & paas products is still in its early stages. as more companies continue to scale their investments in cloud hosting, the most fought-over battleground for these tech companies will continue to be iaas and paas, due to the long-term nature of contracts and substantial contract values.spending will increase among top cloud hosting providers which providers have the largest share of enterprise customers? enterprise customer count business dollars are increasingly shifting from physical on-premises assets to shared cloud assets. gartner forecasts iaas to grow 24% year over year in 2020, which is the highest growth rate across all market segments.despite cloud computing's massive influence in the technology space, cloud spending only represents 5.6% of total it spending, which is on track to hit $3.8 trillion this year, according to gartner.tech spend as a percentage of gdp is projected to double over the next decade. microsoft azure and gcp face significant challenges catching aws by organic grow thin 2019, validation that organic growth might not be enough to catch a cloud leader was demonstrated when ibm acquired red hat for $34 billion to expand its multi-cloud platform. microsoft and oracle also announced a cloud partnership that connects azure services to oracle cloud services.in december, microsoft won a $10 billion technology contract with the department of defense, a deal that ibm, oracle, amazon, and google were also after. the contract puts microsoft in a prime position to earn the estimated $40 billion that the federal government will spend on cloud computing over the next few years, according to daniel ives, wedbush securities analyst. amazon still appears to have a substantial lead by customer count and distribution.with a business that's several times larger than the next few providers combined, you just learn certain lessons in operational experience because you get to different levels of the growth curve and at scale.aws leads the latam market aws has a substantial lead in latam top providers in latam by customer . over the next 10 years, amazon is set to spend $800 million on a new regional data center in argentina, south america's second-largest economy. microsoft recently announced plans to invest $1.1 billion in mexico over the next five years, which will include building a new microsoft azure data center.customers in latin america are looking for better application performance, security, and the ability to meet stringent new compliance requirements. cloud providers like ibm, microsoft, and aws are rolling out new cloud services in the region to meet iaas customer demands.this chart represents the distribution of companies that have active iaas and paas products deployed. the majority of cloud buyers (59%), according to intricately's data, are located in north america, up 43% from 2018 to 2019. for the most valuable segment of enterprise cloud buyers, 42% are located in north america. how much do companies spend on cloud hosting products? percentage of cloud buyers in each spend tier; huge spend ($100k+ / mo) , large spend ($20k+ / mo), med spend ($5k+ / mo), small spend ($1k+ / mo), tiny spend (<$1k / mo), close to half of enterprise cloud buyers are spending less than $10,000 per month, representing an enormous opportunity for cloud vendors to expand usage and growth in the future. nearly half of companies spend less than $1,000 per month on cloud hosting. only 3.3% of companies spend in excess of $1m per year (35,000). enterprises spend a lot of money, but there aren't many of them. the biggest opportunities for cloud companies are the 75% of companies that are early in their cloud adoption. intricately can show you where they are in digital maturity.cloud hosting spend by region cloud hosting spend by region customer count by estimated monthly cloud spend tier; huge spend ($100k+ / mo),large spend ($20k+ / mo),med spend ($5k+ / mo),small spend ($1k+ / mo),this chart represents companies that spend at least $1,000 per month on cloud hosting products. of global companies spending more than $20,000, 49% of them are located in north america.who are the biggest cloud hosting providers?top cloud hosting providers by customer count the largest cloud hosting providers aws gcp alibaba microsoft azure digital ocean .this chart represents customer count among the 10 largest cloud providers, including iaas, paas, and saas products. while companies are spending more on cloud products, they're turning to providers that bundle iaas and paas products, meaning there are fewer providers in the competitive landscape.aws is the market leader for iaas and paas customers, with nearly twice as many total customers as microsoft azure and gcp combined.how do the top cloud hosting providers customer demographics compare?.although microsoft azure has fewer customers than aws, a larger percentage of its customer base consists of enterprise businesses. 5% of microsoft azure customers are enterprises, compared to 1% of aws customers. 72% of aws customers have less than 10 employees. startups represent the largest percentage share of cloud adoption. summary of analysis gartner predicts that public cloud revenue will grow by 17% in 2020. while microsoft azure and google cloud platform continue to grow, aws leads the market in terms of customer count, revenue, and features.cloud providers have a sizable opportunity to expand market share by investing in iaas. it's clear that the market is growing at a substantial rate, which would suggest that there's room for multiple large players in the market.intricately gives cloud providers an unfair advantage in identifying new growth opportunities, defining their total addressable market, and turning analysis into actionable plans for both sales and marketing."
3rd-Party - State of the Developer Nation (Apr 20).pdf,"The 18th annual survey reached over 17k developers in 159 countries to uncover key trends. Javascript and Python remain the most popular languages, while Kotlin has experienced the largest growth, nearly doubling in 2 years. ~60% of developers contribute to open-source software, and almost half of these contributors expect companies to support to open-source communities. Another key insight was the distinction that Machine Learning developers involved in data ingestion more often run code on-premise or in private clouds, while model deployment makes heavier use of public clouds.","about this report/data developer economics is the leading research program on mobile, desktop, industrial iot, consumer electronics, 3rd party ecosystems, cloud, web, game, ar/vr and machine learning developers as well as data scientists, tracking the developer experience across platforms, revenues, apps, languages, tools, APIs, segments and regions.the 18th developer economics global survey wave ran from november 2019 to february 2020 and reached more than 17,000 developers in 159 countries. this research report delves into key developer trends for h1 2020 and beyond. the report focuses on six major themes - each with its own visualizations, showing how the data lends insight into the developer community. programming language communities - an update: programming languages are often the kernels of strong communities and the subject of opinionated debate. in this chapter we provide updated estimates of the number of active software developers using each of the major programming languages, across the globe and across all kinds of programmers. contributing to open-source software: open-source software is ubiquitous in the developer world, but not every developer is also an open-source contributor. in this chapter we explore who the contributors to open-source software are, their reasons for contributing, and finally what open-source support they expect from companies. devops participants and adoption: devops has transformed the way that software is built. but, not all developers and organisations have made the cultural shift. in this chapter we look at how many developers are using ci/cd tools, the technology at centre of the devops process. the analysis also looks at which developers are using these tools, their experience, workplace and background. for some data scientists and machine learning developers, it's not just about pure model development anymore. indeed, the emphasis has shifted to real-world production scenarios that are concerned with issues such as inference performance, scaling, load balancing and so on. these require computation power, which in the past has been a huge hindrance for machine learning developers. in this chapter, we explore where machine learning developers run their app or project's code, and how it differs based on how they are involved in machine learning/ai, what they're using it for, as well as which algorithms and frameworks they're using. augmented & virtual reality: augmented reality (ar) and virtual reality (vr) are two development areas that have surged in popularity in recent years as the technology has matured and more devices support ar and vr capabilities. in this chapter we explore the profile of ar and vr developers and non-developers, focusing on their involvement in other sectors, their technology and device choices and what they are building. emerging technologies: we have been tracking the adoption and engagement of emerging technologies for two years. in this chapter we discuss which technologies have increased and decreased in popularity over the previous twelve months. programming language communities - an updatethe choice of programming language matters deeply to developers because they want to keep their skills up to date and marketable. languages are a beloved subject of debate and the kernels of some of the strongest developer communities. they matter to toolmakers too, as they want to make sure they provide the most useful sdks. key insights javascript remains the most popular programming language, with more than 12m developers worldwide using it.python added 2.2m net new developers in 2018 and surpassed java in terms of popularity. it is now the second largest programming language community overall. kotlin is the fastest growing language community in percentage terms. it nearly doubled in size in the past two years. 3 out of 5 developers contribute to open-source software. developers are most motivated to contribute to open-source projects to improve coding skills (29%) and because they believe in the benefits of open source (26%).almost half of open-source contributors expect companies to support and contribute to open-source communities.developers using ci/cd tools are 20 percentage points more likely to be professional developers. 58% of developers using ci/cd tools work for firms with more than 10 people involved in software development.while amateurs are less likely to leverage cloud computing infrastructures than professional ml developers, they are as likely as professionals to run their code on hardware other than cpu. ml developers working with big data and deep learning frameworks are more likely to deploy their code on hybrid and multi clouds.ml developers involved in data ingestion are more likely to run their code on private clouds and on-premise servers, while those involved in model deployment make heavier use of public clouds to deploy their machine learning solutions. augmented reality (ar) and virtual reality (vr) practitioners are in the majority passionate hobbyists with a diverse set of interests and skills. the majority (57%) of ar and vr hobbyists work professionally in at least one other development area. 22% of ar & vr non-developers are learning how to code. the most popular languages for this group are java, c++ and c#.most developers (59%) are engaged with devops and 27% of these are currently working on projects involving devops. fog/edge computing has seen one of the largest increases in engagement and adoption in the previous twelve months.economic sstate of the developer nation q4 201901programming language communities -

3rd-party - Supply Chains Evolving to be Growth Drivers (Jun-20).pdf,"COVID-19 has moved the focus of supply chains beyond efficiency to support company growth and purpose. Accenture conducted research with top-level executives across nine industries at 900 companies around the globe. They found that 10% of companies are supply chain Masters that leverage their supply chains to achieve 13% higher growth, 3X higher contribution to total revenue, and 2.5% higher EBITDA margin than Others. Customer centricity, robust digital architecture, purposeful innovation, and executive commitment to supply chain excellence are consistent traits of Masters.","supply chains have traditionally been seen as drivers of efficiencies and scale, providing competitive cost advantage. in recent years, though, the role of supply chains has evolved beyond efficiency to growth. the stakes for growth are high in accenture's most recent supply we expect customers to continue to chain research, our surveyed demand an experience in which supply companies have invested, on average, chains respond with a higher purpose us $153.4 million to transform their supply chain for growth (2017-2019).our research, with top-level executives across nine industries at 900 companies in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic hastened around the globe, shows a few select and intensified changes to the consumer and leaders are transforming their supply chains customer landscape. beyond business growth, to contribute to a customer experience supply chains became more important than that leads to purpose-led growth. ever, helping save lives by getting critical we discovered this : our masters supplies to the people who need them, have been able to successfully reshape their companies with robust supply chains to create significant impact are showing resiliency through this crisis, on their topline growth, versus their peers. combined with a responsibility not just to the business, but also to the greater good of society. in the aftermath of covid-19, with increased disruption in the world in general, i think everybody is realizing how important it is to have a supply chain that is solid and resilient, in the sense of being able to recover faster from any challenging situation. having such capabilities is making the role of the supply chain officer a stronger competitive element of the leadership team. topline growth sails above peer companies the investments that masters are making, in time and money, are paying off in four ways:13% revenue growth rate 2.5% higher EBITDA margin 3x higher contribution to total revenue daily share price during the covid-19 crisis that remains above their peers see what do supply chain masters do differently? the good news: the masters approach is an imitable formula that can help companies create more resilient, purposeful supply chains that fuel growth. and we know that is more essential than ever in today's world.  masters begin with the customer in mind. they base their supply chain strategy on what the customer values. masters help turn insight into innovation. they invest in digital architecture, creating a foundation for collaboration, inside and out. masters are highly mature in select capabilities. they focus on those that enhance supply chain agility and foster innovations, building security in. masters engage their chief executive officer (ceo) to move beyond conversation to true transformation. these ceos ensure board-level support while funding supply chain innovation and talent. top supply chain challenges our analysis reveals five major challenges companies experience, as they rebuild for resiliency and growth. while these challenges existed before covid-19 struck, they're magnified by the pandemic.flexibility: difficulty differentiating customer offerings on demand because manufacturing and supply chain lack flexibility.ecosystem design :  inability to identify the right partners to innovate and deliver value on demand.digital architecture : technology architecture is not designed to drive cross collaboration and co-innovation.innovation :supply chain innovation pipeline is not robust enough, and lacks the ability to scale beyond prototype testing.visibility : supply chain lacks the end-to-end, real-time visibility that creates trust and transparency for customers.let's explore these four areas in more detail.a license for growth: customer-centric supply chain masters begin with the customer in mind they base their supply chain strategy on what the customer values, which is a more complex endeavor than it used to be because customer experience is now tailored and personalized.customers demand more connected, seamless, customized and secure experiences. as customers rapidly move toward products and services as experiences, they expect companies to provide a more holistic package. supply chains play a crucial role in creating this value-driven customer experience. 71% of masters deliver experiences linked to the right customer value propositions.accenture analysis shows that investing in building analytical, asset-light collaboration architectures may significantly increase the supply chain's impact on revenue.collaboration, innovation and data-driven insight technologies accounted for 8% of master's 13% average revenue growth. masters understand that addressing changing customer expectations makes a huge difference, so they focus on the value propositions that matter most when investing in their supply chains. customer value propositions prioritized for supply chain investments..data privacy and secure experiences highlights customer value proposition given as a top priority by both b2b masters and b2c masters highlights the unique customer value proposition between b2b masters and b2c masters.b2b and b2c shared value propositions , b2b and b2c industries share a few customer value propositions. top of the list for both is supply chain and manufacturing sustainability. people around the globe are more conscious about the products they are consuming where they are sourced, how they are made and how they are recycled. they are increasingly looking for companies that share their environmental, ethical and social values. buying and sourcing ethically, recycling, and reducing environmental footprints have now become an integral part of a company's brand value. it is not surprising, then, that the masters in our survey have identified creating sustainable supply chains as their top priority. in the b2c sector, we see companies like conagra brands making firm commitments to sustainability. conagra is aiming to convert its plastic packaging into renewable, recyclable or compostable packaging by 2025. in the b2b sector, dhl was a pioneer on emissions reduction in the transportation industry, reaching its 2020 goal of a 30% reduction four years ahead of schedule.the company's new mission is to drive toward zero emissions in 2050. beyond sustainability, masters share some common value propositions, from data privacy and secure experiences to customized delivery and service. 10and in both sectors, b2b and b2c, masters are working on a seamless, connected customer experience. for example, accenture helped a consumer goods company create hundreds of segments of all their customer/product combinations. for each of these segments, they defined a complete set of supply chain requirements. segments with similar requirements are now plotted in one of five supply chain types, each with their supply chain strategy. this setup allows this big global player to create a level of customer intimacy and accuracy similar to what smaller niche players can achieve.an industry leader in sustainability, seven years running , abbott has been named the global industry leader for the seventh consecutive year by the dow jones sustainability index (djsi) for sustainable and responsible business, they aim to integrate sustainability into every aspect of their business. for example, they embrace a circular model where all waste, from factory waste to cafeteria waste, is recycled, reused, composted or responsibly incinerated, with much of that energy being recaptured for future use. the results: 27% less water usage and 42% lower overall emissions in 2018. improving environmental performance also strengthened their business by improving operational efficiency. since 2010, reduced product packaging has eliminated approximately 41 million pounds of packaging and resulted in more than us$100 million in savings.b2b masters emphasize product-as-a-service models the b2b masters are working toward product-it also helps free up customer resources in terms of finances, expertise and as-a-service models, to deliver connected dedicated personnel to be invested in customer experiences. the aim is to provide their core business activities. for example, products as managed services, which enables agricultural manufacturer greater control and monitoring of the products broadened its focus from building state-of-for companies, and better service and the-art farm machinery to the value-added experience for their customers. product-as-services their products can provide. a-service moves companies into longer-term relationships with consumers, versus just a sale. the company now collects data insights from machines in the field to help farmers with precision agriculture.hpe chief executive officer (ceo) pledges to sell everything as a service by 2022 . hpe ceo, antonio neri, has made a bold promise: by 2022, every product hewlett packard enterprise sells will be available as a service. 201cin the next three years hpe will be a consumption-driven company and everything delivered to you will be delivered as a service,neri said. you choose what you want, where you want it, and only pay for what you consume.the company has recognized customers want the flexibility and security a cloud experience provides, which includes pay-per-use and not having to sink capital to build, run and maintain extensive infrastructure. this model gives customers the constant innovation they expect, including a constant stream of new features from which to select. b2c masters focus on hyper-personalization , b2c masters are more focused on creating hyper-personalized customer experiences. b2c companies work closely with their customers and their ecosystem partners to deliver innovative tailor-made products and solutions anytime, anyplace, leading to the type of customer loyalty that produces growth. to address their unique viewing habits.not only that, netflix uses predictive analytics for guiding and scaling original content into localized content that is accessible and relatable to as many viewers as possible across different cultures and in different languages. historical viewing trends across a range of languages and viewer segments enable them to create a seamless localized experience.creating a seamless, connected experience requires an agile supply chain and customer focused. as our masters have shown, a customer-centric supply chain can influence revenue growth significantly.netflix is a fitting example. to start with, each subscriber has a different view of the content on their webpage adapted to their preferences and interests. with 182 million netflix subscribers worldwide,this enables netflix to have hundreds and millions of products instead of just one. starting from the homepage design and layout, personalization flows through to the messages and alerts sent to customers, based on numerous algorithms customer centricity in action: product customization at the retail point of sale multinational chemical company basf has partnered with french company b2b cosmetics to create a system that allows customers to formulate and take home customized personal care products from haircare to skincare.emuage, a small machine that looks and operates a bit like a coffeemaker, combines water with individual pods that make up a product's texture, fragrance and active ingredient. this can be done at the point of sale to provide the hyper-personalization customers demand in today's personal care market. the modular approach to manufacturing product ingredients allows an agility and response to demand that exceed what a traditional supply chain can offer.we're focused on better forecasting, better replenishment, and working with our suppliers to optimize that side of the supply chain. right now (due to covid-19), we're testing those systems to their limit because we2019re seeing demand that we've never seen before. we're seeing customer buying patterns that we've never seen before, but that's giving us better forecast insight than we've ever had. if we're to have something again like this, we'll be able to utilize that type of data to better forecast what we can do to get in front of it.masters have recognized that creating value for customers relies on continuous, iterative collaboration.data has become the new currency feeding that value, so masters are investing in new technologies to turn data into insights. as they mature, they move from diagnostic to predictive and prescriptive business models. this helps provide a solid basis for collaboration inside the company and with ecosystem partners to meet customer expectations.during the coronavirus crisis, Unilever nv used artificial intelligence (ai) to comb through millions of deliveries and thousands of suppliers to spot potential risks or shortages2014so it could quickly innovate on alternatives. 16the company's chief supply chain officer, marc engel, explained why being predictive and proactive matters in a bloomberg interview: it's all about can i get my raw materials, do i have enough people to run my factories, and can trucks drive across countries to deliver the goods. you can sit and wait around until it happens, but then you're usually too late. more than two-thirds of masters 13% average revenue growth came from collaboration, innovation and data-driven insight technologies.we have a platform called r360 (resilience360) where we take all different types of data weather feeds, political situations, traffic patterns and feeds from our own systems and assetsusing technologies like satellites and smart sensors. combine that onto a visual map, powered by [direct applications], and you have visibility of your supply chain.analysis shows that investing in building analytical, asset-light collaboration architectures may significantly increase the supply chain's impact on revenue.collaboration, innovation and data-driven insight technologies accounted for more than two-thirds of master's 13% average revenue growth. investments in analytical asset-light architecture pays off 3.7% incremental gains 7.8% 4.1%gains when investing in less than three technologies .kenco has now created a 10,000 square-foot warehouse space, whichis a prototype development center.kenco logistics: turning leading-edge ideas into prototypes kenco logistics, north america's leading third-party logistics provider, launched the kenco supply chain innovation lab to create a competitive advantage by combining their integrated suite of technologies with a data ecosystem. its team of innovation specialists collaborates with customers, vendors and entrepreneurs from various industries to identify, research and prototype leading-edge ideas and processes. kenco has now created a 10,000-square-foot warehouse space, which is a prototype development center where supply chain management solutions and technologies are tested for accuracy and sustainability. new technologies like robotics, augmented reality, 3d printing, vision picking using smart glasses, and voice picking are all brought into this space to deliver insight through industry experience.we are really changing how we run things. we have a production system which is built on digitalization. for example, we're not physically building any prototypes anymore. instead, we build digital twins of products we want to manufacture. there is no physical thing anymore. we test products in an augmented reality environment. from design to product, it's all digital. masters are highly mature in select capabilities they focus on capabilities that enhance supply chain agility and foster innovations, while building in security. top 5 capabilities where companies enjoy the highest level of maturity b2b masters . 1b2c masters have made significant investment in piloting or scaling blockchain capabilitiesblockchaincustomer and

partnershave established external partnerships to improve efficiencies as well as to innovate new products.capabilities shared by b2b and b2c masters are rapidly developing key customer-experience capabilities and are ahead of their peers in implementing these capabilities, which gives them greater supply chain agility. both b2b and b2c masters are focused on understanding their customers better and providing differentiated on-demand products and services. masters have invested in building advanced capabilities to segment their customers and products in real-time so they can better deliver personalized product and service offerings. in tandem, they are investing in advanced cybersecurity to address the growing digital threats from security breaches and data theft. they realize keeping company and customer data safe while avoiding system breaches and breakdowns is crucial. today, 84% of organizations spend over 20% of their cybersecurity budget on advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (ai), machine learning or robotic process automation (rpa), compared to only 41% of organizations three years ago.with 40% of cybersecurity attacks now occurring indirectly through the supply chain, cloud or managed providers.companies across industries are stepping up their efforts in this area.in b2b and b2c industries, masters are also partnering with procurement to help design products and services and to identify potential suppliers, to achieve target margins. they work with procurement to innovate on sourcing and sustainability. beyond these shared approaches, masters in each sector are maturing capabilities with the most value to them.b2b companies make strides towards pay-as-you-use model b2b masters are moving toward a product-as-a-service model, making transparency and traceability more important than ever. they are integrating blockchain with ai, the internet of things (iot) and robotics to enhance their capabilities in this area. as products-as-a-service rise in popularity, companies are monitoring and maintaining a large pool of connected assets for their customers making predictive asset maintenance a critical capability. using cognitive and predictive capabilities to help optimize a product's lifecycle enables drastic reduction in service disruptions and proactive maintenance services to customers. b2c companies find human + machine balance on the other hand, as b2c masters are focusing on delivering hyper-personalized experiences to their consumers, they are building warehouse automation capabilities. machine-to-machine order management not only helps them achieve speed and accuracy in fulfilling consumer orders but also helps enable customization at a micro level. companies can fulfill customized orders and handle diverse inventories quickly and with minimal human intervention. with the number of direct-to-consumer orders increasing, spurred by the covid-19 situation, automation has become even more essential to speed and business continuity.also, for b2c masters, hyper-personalized experiences bring a complexity that makes collaborative innovation, internally and with ecosystem partners, a must. innovation center networks are helping more companies make collaborative innovation a reality. through our dhl innovation center network, we collaborate with more than 50 partners to help our customers. people talk about drone deliveries. we're already doing that in africa, thanks to this network. we deliver medical supplies and samples three times a day from a hospital to a village on the other side of a massive lake. it would probably take three or four hours to drive around, pick up samples, and then drive back for them to be tested. we have an unmanned drone that does this faster by flying over the water. it's all automated and this solution started with a customer need.masters engage their ceos to move beyond conversation to true transformation. ceos ensure board-level support while funding supply chain innovation and talent. ceos are more likely to drive supply chain discussions with the board. and they translate those discussions into results actively allocating funds and talent that fuel innovation capabilities and transformation for their supply chain.apple's tim cook has been a vocal proponent of supply chain transformation for his company, with

3rd-Party - Uncertainty in Global Software Market Forecasts (Jul-20).pdf,"Over the past two decades, the growth rate of a countrys software investment has generally been closely correlated with its nominal GDP. However financial releases, earnings forecasts, and Forresters own revenues estimates of 1,000+ software companies reveal that many vendors are not projecting declines in 2020 revenues. Expectations for double-digit revenue growth in 2020 rest on hopes that the US and other economies will recover quickly in the third or fourth quarters of this year. Those hopes may be realized in a few countries, such as Australia, China, Germany, the Nordics, and Southeast Asia. But they are looking less likely for the US, the UK, Southern Europe, South America and India.","forecasting in uncertainty: are software vendors too optimistic, or are we too pessimistic about the software market outlook? forrester featured insights as i work on updating forrester's tech market forecasts for the us and the world, i have been struck by the disconnect between how i see the software market outlook and how vendors and investors see it. in my forecast work on the tech market over the past two decades, i have found a generally close correlation between the growth rate in nominal gdp and the growth rate in software investment in a country. for example, the quarterly growth in us gdp compared with the quarterly growth in business investment in software over the past 20 years shows that declines in gdp correspond with declines in software investment. similarly, in canada, which also has this level of data, a similar pattern holds. the charts below show these relationships. using a model based on the relationship between gdp and software growth, we have projected that us software purchases will drop by 7% in 2020 (under the more likely scenario b) and that canadian software purchases will drop by 6% . however, in our more comprehensive tech market reports, we go one and two levels below these top-line numbers for the total software market and size individual software product markets. to do so, i go through financial releases, earnings forecasts, and our own estimates of the revenues of over 1,000 software companies. in updating these numbers, it has become clear that many vendors are not projecting declines in their revenue in 2020. the exception is licensed software vendors, which are generally forecasting that their revenues will decline in 2020. for example, sap, in its preliminary financial results for q2 2019, posted a 17% drop in license revenues. but software-as-a-service (saas) vendors are still projecting that their revenues will grow in 2020, albeit with one or two quarters of soft growth. using yahoo finance's data for a dozen leading saas vendors, the consensus equity analyst forecasts for revenue growth in fiscal 2020 averaged 21.6%; taking just the low estimates, the average is still 19.7%. if anything, these equity analyst forecasts understate vendor expectations. equity analysts generally derive their revenue forecasts from guidance from vendor cfos, who have a tendency to set low expectations that their company can then beat. so how do we reconcile these two radically different views of the software market outlook? here are the two options: option 1: forrester's software forecasting model is too conservative, and our forecasts should be adjusted upward to reflect new cloud realities. the wide discrepancy between our software market forecasts and the software vendor revenue forecasts has caused me to review my forecasting model. saas subscription contracts, in principle, can introduce new stability in software revenues. historically, when software was primarily sold on a license basis, an economic downturn would cause companies to stop or delay these purchases. that caused a relatively quick fall in software spending and, thus, in vendor revenues. but cloud offerings have a different spending pattern 2014 relatively little in the first year but increased spending in future years. so cutbacks in new purchases have less immediate impacts on software spending 2014 on average, about a fifth of the drop that would have occurred with licensed software. instead, cuts in cloud subscription spending will mostly require canceling or renegotiating the contract with the vendor. while cmos have generally insisted on short, one-year contracts with their marketing technology vendors, cios and most other business buyers have tended to opt for multiyear contracts. saas vendors have welcomed that practice and have generally used pricing structures that keep annual costs to clients fixed or growing. all things else being equal, that could mean that saas spending would slow but still post positive growth.cloud subscriptions whether for multitenant saas from the saas vendors or single-instance hosted subscriptions represent a larger share of software. in the us, cloud subscription fees will represent 39% of total us software spending in 2020, up from 19% in 2016. so even a slow rate of growth in software subscription could offset most if not all of the drop in licensed software fees and erosion in software maintenance fees. option 2: vendors revenue projections are too optimistic, and actual results will be worse than they assume. as my recent blog showed, there is hidden weakness in saas vendors earnings reports and projections (see forecasting in uncertainty: warning signs inside the saas vendors recent earnings reports). here are some additional reasons why this may be the case: so far, vendors can point to having relatively few clients that have demonstrated a need for cost reduction. but it's early days. the industries that have been hit hard by the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to contain it represent just 7% of total nongovernment software spending in 2019, according to u.s. bureau of economic analysis (bea) data.** these industries share of what the bea calls prepackaged software (in which saas would generally be counted) is higher, at 12%, but they represent only 4% of custom software (i.e., customizable commercial software) and of on-account (custom-built) software. but as the pandemic continues to rage and the economic recession deepens and broadens, other industries e.g., financial services, insurance, professional services, manufacturing, education, and government could come under pressure. these make the bulk of software purchases, so their pressure to cut software costs may not surface until q3 or q4 of 2020. in practice, individual vendors subscription revenues still could fall significantly below expectations. the book of annual recurring revenue of the saas vendors is not as solid as they think. some clients will fail and go out of business. others will file for bankruptcy, as brooks brothers, chesapeake energy, j.crew, jcpenney, and neiman marcus have already done, voiding the contract. other clients will be able to negotiate delays of payment, reductions in payment terms, or other fee waivers. the longer and deeper the recession, the more likely that saas clients will be forced into this position. even if larger saas vendors can hold the line on contracted revenues, smaller saas vendors may not be able to do so or may fail. in recessions, the strong survive and the weak fail. the large saas vendors we reviewed make up a large share of the saas market, but not the majority. so they may still experience growth while the small-fry saas vendors struggle, fail, or get acquired. the bottom line? we are probably a little too pessimistic. but the saas vendors are much too optimistic. in markets such as the us, where saas has high penetration, the software market drop will not be as steep as our model has suggested. in the us, i now think software purchases will drop by 3% in 2020, not the 7% i projected in april. but i think our model is still appropriate for countries such as canada, china, france, germany, and the uk, where saas has made fewer inroads. at the same time, i think many saas vendors are whistling past the graveyard, to use an old country expression. their expectations for double-digit revenue growth in 2020 rest on hopes that the us and other economies will recover quickly in the third or fourth quarters of this year. those hopes may be realized in a few countries, such as australia, china, germany, the nordics, and southeast asia. but they are looking less and less likely for the us, the uk, southern europe, south america, and india. i think that many of the saas vendors are more likely to see single-digit growth in 2020 rather than the double-digit growth they now assume. * the saas vendors we looked at were adobe, box, cloudera, cornerstone ondemand, coupa, dropbox, hubspot, mongodb, salesforce, slack, twilio, workday, and zendesk. ** the industries we included were oil and gas (drilling and refining), retail, air transportation, transit and ground transportation, ambulatory care providers, nursing home providers, museums, art and entertainment, amusement, gambling and recreation, accommodation, and restaurants.

Accenture's detailed modeling of cybersecurity performance identified an elite group just 18% of that achieve significantly higher levels of performance in at least three of these categories:when an industry completely reinvents its products and its ways of doing business, it's an exciting challenge. when it does so in the middle of a pandemic, it's a heroic effort. the automotive industry has grappled with both scenarios in 2020.auto companies were already focused on moving to connected, clean vehicles before covid-19, but have now found themselves challenged to retool and reorient to manufacture life-saving products like ventilators.the learned agility that came from their covid-19 efforts will likely help auto companies as they revitalize post-pandemic. and as they do, they'll

heavy responsibility on manufacturers currently, there are few legal regulations on cybersecurity in the automotive sector. in mid-2020, regulations a working party of the sustainable transport division of the united nations economic commission for europe will change that in europe.as we write this cybersecurity report, the un ece will issue in late 2020 or early 2021 a regulation on

dozen secure locations finds itself grappling with a remote workforce globally and are now located in thousands during this time period.of unsecured home locations instead. and our survey respondents shared that the top target for cyberattacks was their corporate organization ranging from attacks on intellectual property to employee information.zero trust systems: dynamic cybersecurity for dynamic businesses with the increasing amount of remote work generated by covid-19 likely to continue, we expect more companies to move to zero trust systems and adaptive security. they are powered by analytics and automation and enhance the security posture of any organization. this approach is particularly effective for companies with an increasing number of system entry points. it works against opportunistic and targeted attacks, as well as trusted insiders and other insider threats.zero trust means constant verification. even if a user is inside a company's network, a company will not assume it's safe. instead, it is provided granular user-access control as never before for authentication and verification. unlike traditional static security approaches, adaptive security includes context-aware security access policies and controls. these shift dynamically based on the risk of every access request, and help a business detect anomalies faster and more accurately. connected car

shows that 41% of automotive company security breaches come from indirect attacks, or hidden attacks via their ecosystem.currently, only roughly two-thirds of automotive companies oversee the cybersecurity practices of their technology providers, auto parts providers and dealerships. delivery and other services rank even lower. this practice leaves a huge door for cybercriminals to enter

technologies and decouple their core architecture to allow for innovative collaboration, their cybersecurity strategy needs to change. many are handling the basics well, but the business has moved beyond basic cybersecurity needs. the sophistication and severity of cyberattacks is increasing at an alarming rate, significantly impacting companies across industries. the average cost of cybercrime for an organization has increased us $1.4 million to us $13.0 million.now more than ever, as auto companies move from vehicle manufacturing specialists to technology ecosystem specialists, their cybersecurity needs become far more complex and critical. a connected car stems from a web of interconnected companies with varying levels of cybersecurity expertise.focusing on action in a few key areas can help automotive companies advance their cybersecurity to better meet the new needs of the business:reassess cybersecurity using an end-to-end approach. new regulations are a bellwether for things to come, holding automotive companies responsible for secure management of areas like data at rest and data in transit. cybersecurity in an intelligent vehicle has become a matter of life or death.look beyond traditional boundaries. auto companies will more and more have to take cybersecurity standards and enforcement across the ecosystem and their own distributed operations into their hands to protect their own interests. take a proactive stance with regulators and shared industry intelligence. regulators need input from automotive companies to create standards that protect consumers but are also realistic for manufacturers. reaching out to offer assistance and subject matter expertise helps ensure a public/private partnership for the mutual good. and industry groups like the automotive information sharing and analysis center (auto-isac) serve as a global information-sharing community to address vehicle cybersecurity risks. auto-isac operates a central hub for

ACEA - Making Transition to Zero-Emission Mobility (Oct-20).pdf,"European sales of passenger EV cars and vans will have to pick up strongly if the 2025 and 2030 CO2 reduction targets  adopted last year by the European Parliament and Council  are to be achieved. Despite Auto OEM efforts, EV market penetration across the EU remains low and fragmented. Furthermore, EU governments must ramp investments in charging and refueling infrastructure and enact meaningful, sustainable incentives to stimulate sales of alternatively powered vehicles. Analysis of factors such as national income and charging point density show correlations on the market uptake in different countries.","making the transition to zero-emission mobility progress report enabling factors for alternatively-powered cars and vans in the european union.market uptake alternatively-powered cars + vans 3.0% of all cars sold in 2019 were electrically-chargeable (+2.4 percentage points since 2014). 5.9% of new cars in the eu were hybrid electric last year (+4.5 percentage points over six years).0.5% of all cars sold in 2019 were natural gas-powered (-0.3 percentage points since 2014). fuel cell vehicles currently account for a small share (0.04%) of total eu car sales. 2.8% of new van sales were alternatively-powered last year.1.2% of all vans sold in 2019 were electrically-chargeable (+0.7 percentage points over six years), and 0.2% were hybrid electric.co2 emissions of new passenger cars + vans in 2017, petrol vehicles became the most sold car type in the eu for the first time since 2009.2017 also marked the first rise (+0.3%) in new-car co2 emissions since records began.2019 was the third consecutive year when co2 from cars increased (+1.8%) to reach an eu-wide average of 123g co2/km. co2 emissions from vans grew for the second consecutive year in 2019, going up by 0.4% to reach an eu-wide average of 158.5g co2/km. affordability: the market uptake of electrically-chargeable vehicles (ecvs) is directly correlated to a country's gdp per capita, showing that affordability is a major barrier to consumers. all countries with an ecv market share of less than 1% have a gdp below 30,000, including eu member states in central and eastern europe, but also italy and greece. more than 80% of all electric cars are sold in just 6 eu countries, with some of the highest gdps. 21 eu countries now offer bonus payments or premiums to buyers of ecvs. these purchase incentives, and especially their monetary value, differ greatly across the european union. infrastructure availability: although the deployment of ecv infrastructure has seen strong growth, the total number of charging points available across the eu (199,825) still falls far short of what is required. only 28,586 of those points are suitable for fast charging (capacity of >22kw), while normal points account for the vast majority. just 1 in 7 charging points in the eu is a fast charger today. according to conservative estimates by the european commission, at least 2.8 million ecv charging points will be needed by 2030. that means a 14-fold increase within the next 11 years. four countries covering 27% of the eu's total surface area the netherlands, germany, france and the uk account for more than 75% of all ecv charging points in the eu.there are 137 hydrogen filling stations across 12 eu member states, but 16 countries do not have any at all.the eu counts more than 3,700 natural gas filling stations, up 30.8% since 2014. two-thirds of these are concentrated in two countries alone (italy and germany).progress report making the transition to zero-emission mobility introduction the contextlast year, the european parliament and council adopted regulation (eu) 2019/631 introducing co2 emission standards for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (vans) in the european union. this regulation set reduction targets of -15% and -37.5% for the tailpipe co2 emissions of newly-registered cars for the years 2025 and 2030 respectively. the 2030 target for vans is -31%. the new car targets follow on from the target of 95g co2/km for the year 2021, set in 2013.using laboratory test (wltp) results, manufacturers progress is monitored each year by the member states based on new registration data.in 2021 the european commission will review the regulation, reporting back to the european parliament and council on the progress made towards reaching the co2 targets. amongst other things, this mid-term review will take stock of the roll-out of charging and refuelling infrastructure for alternatively-powered vehicles, their market uptake, as well as co2 reductions from the fleet.the purpose of this reportsales of electric and other alternatively-powered passenger cars and vans including electrically-chargeable, hybrid, fuel cell and natural gas-powered vehicles will have to pick up strongly if the 2025 and 2030 co2 targets are to be achieved. all european automobile manufacturers are constantly expanding their portfolios of such vehicles. however, their market penetration remains low and fragmented across the eu.in order to drive this shift to zero- and low-emission vehicles, governments across the eu need to ramp up investments in charging and refuelling infrastructure, and to put in place meaningful and sustainable incentives to stimulate sales of alternatively-powered vehicles. the purpose of this report is to track progress on these key enabling factors for both passenger cars and vans. indeed, for the first time, the 2020 edition of the acea progress report also includes data on light commercial vehicles .the european automobile manufacturers association (acea) is publishing this statistical report on an annual basis in the run-up to the mid-term review of regulation (eu) 2019/631, with a view to monitoring the availability of infrastructure and purchase incentives. acea will put this in the context of the composition of the new vehicle market by fuel type and the average co2 emissions of new cars and vans. this report also makes a number of correlations, analysing the influence of some factors such as national income or the number of charging points per 100 km of road on the market uptake of alternatively-powered vehicles. this report provides a factual, data-driven picture of progress, bringing together all available data sources (acea, eafo2, eea, eurostat, ihs markit). in all cases it is the latest available full-year data.although the united kingdom is no longer part of the european union (as of 1 february 2020), this year's edition of the progress report covers the former eu28 perimeter, as all data sets in this report cover time frames during which the uk was still an eu member state. this date was brought forward from 2023 in december 2019. currently, the only available source of eu-wide infrastructure data for all types of alternatively-powered vehicles is the european commission's european alternative fuels observatory (eafo), report making the transition to zero-emission mobilityglossaryconventionally-powered vehiclesconventional vehicles use fossil fuels (diesel and petrol) to power an internal combustion engine (ice). both diesel and petrol engines convert fuel into energy via combustion, with the main difference being the way the combustion process occurs. diesel fuel has a higher energy content per litre than other fuels. moreover, diesel engines convert more of this energy into useful work. due to these two factors, diesel vehicles consume less fuel by volume than equivalent petrol vehicles.consequently, diesel vehicles have lower average co2 emissions per kilometre than equivalent petrol-powered ones. although this gap is narrowing, it still remains significant. according to a recent report by the european environment agency (eea), 201cif similar petrol and diesel segments are compared, new conventional petrol cars emitted 10-40% more [co2] than new conventional diesel cars.alternatively-powered vehiclesalternatively-powered vehicles (apvs) are vehicles powered by technologies alternative to, or supplemental to, conventional internal combustion engines using fossil fuels. the main types of apvs, and how they differ from each other, are explained below.  electric vehicleselectric vehicles include electrically-chargeable vehicles (ecvs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (fcevs). both are propelled by an electric motor but require very different infrastructure. electrically-chargeable vehicleselectrically-chargeable vehicles (ecvs) include full battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, both of which require recharging infrastructure which connects them to the electricity grid. battery electric vehicles (bevs) are fully powered by an electric motor, using electricity stored in an on-board battery that is charged by plugging into the electricity grid. plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (phevs) have an internal combustion engine (running on petrol or diesel) and a battery-powered electric motor. the battery is recharged by connecting to the grid as well as by the on-board engine. depending on the battery level, the vehicle can run on the electric motor and/or the internal combustion engine. fuel cell electric vehiclesfuel cell electric vehicles (fcevs) are also propelled by an electric motor, but their electricity is generated within the vehicle by a fuel cell that uses compressed hydrogen (h2) and oxygen from the air. so, unlike ecvs, they are not recharged by connecting to the electricity grid. instead, fcevs require dedicated hydrogen filling stations.2020 progress report making the transition to zero-emission mobility 2014 hybrid electric vehicleshybrid electric vehicles (hevs) have an internal combustion engine (running on petrol or diesel) and a battery-powered electric motor. electricity is generated internally from regenerative braking, cruising and the combustion engine, so they do not need recharging infrastructure. the hybridisation level ranges from mild to full. 2022 mild hybrid electric vehicles are powered by an internal combustion engine, but also have a battery-powered electric motor that supports the conventional engine. these vehicles cannot be powered by the electric motor alone. 2022 full hybrid electric vehicles are powered by both an electric motor and a combustion engine, each of which (or together) can power the wheels. natural gas vehiclesnatural gas vehicles (ngvs) run on compressed natural gas (cng) or liquefied natural gas (lng), the latter mainly being used for commercial vehicles such as trucks and the former for passenger cars. ngvs are based on mature technologies and use internal combustion engines. dedicated refuelling infrastructure is required.electrified and vehicles some people presume that the term electrified or electric refers exclusively to battery electric vehicles (bevs) that are fully powered by electricity and have no co2 coming from their tailpipe.however, in practice electrified and electric are often used as blanket terms for all available electrification technologies, ie bevs, phevs and hevs. the reality is that each of these technologies has different requirements in terms of infrastructure as well as varying co2 reduction levels. findings between 2014-2019, the petrol market grew by 3.6 million units, reaching 9 million cars in 2019.the number of diesel cars sold dropped by almost 2 million units over the same timeframe. electrically-chargeable cars increased by 389,000 (to

Bain - Auto OEM Strategies for Electric and Autonomous Mobility (Oct-20).pdf,"OEMs have reached a critical juncture, heightened by the pandemic. With little financial cushion, decisions in the months ahead will likely determine the future of the business. Few companies can afford to invest in all opportunities created by both EVs and AVs, ultimately requiring strategic trade-offs. Bain suggests that OEMs reduce complexity and cost of EVs, win new customer segments, and forge EV partnerships. To capture value in AVs, OEMs must define a position in the mobility value chain, have points of contact with the end user, and secure access to L4 technology. It is against this backdrop that HERE can frame conversations with its OEM customers.","electric and autonomous vehicles: the future is now with the right trade-offs and strategic partnerships, original equipment manufacturers still have a chance to keep up in the race for electric and autonomous mobility. electric and autonomous vehicles: the future is now at a glance bain forecasts the electric vehicle market will start rapidly scaling around 2024, escalating original equipment manufacturers race to keep up with tech competitors. at the same time, the pandemic is chipping away at automakers' financial cushion and threatening to hamper progress in the autonomous vehicle development market that we expect to reach a turning point around 2028. oems can seize opportunities and manage threats for the impending ev- and av-driven future by making strategic investment trade-offs and forging critical partnerships tech companies have secured their place in the fast lane of an electrified, autonomous world2014and original equipment manufacturers (oems) are hurrying to keep up. consider one leading indicator: german regulators have granted mobileye, intel's autonomous vehicle (av) division, a permit to test its driverless cars on public roads, in real-world traffic. mobileye is one of the first nontraditional manufacturers to receive the go-ahead for testing, giving the firm an opportunity to surpass traditional manufacturers, despite their early start.as they race to keep up with digitally minded and cash-flush tech companies, the covid-19 pandemic also threatens to hamper progress for some oems. conserving cash and containing costs are now urgent priorities, requiring careful calibration of research and development (r&d) and capex investments. inevitably, this involves tough choices. daimler and bmw, for instance, have put their av collaboration on hold in light of high costs. at the same time, daimler has teamed up with nvidia to develop a software-based vehicle architecture for autonomous driving. in addition, the automaker recently announced a partnership with waymo to build a level 4 autonomous truck , one that can drive itself without human interaction under certain circumstances. reducing investments in in-house development for av technologies allows oems to shift limited resources to more timely opportunities, such as their push for electrification.daimler and bmw wouldn't be alone in their thinking; the global crisis could catalyze the adoption of electric vehicles (ev). european governments are using economic stimulus to push for a more sustainable post-pandemic world. france, italy and germany are boosting ev subsidies as part of their recovery plans. the chinese government, which previously planned to roll back ev subsidies by the end of the year, has decided instead to extend some modified incentives until 2022, hoping to ease automakers2019 pain. in addition, major ride-hailing companies, such as lyft and uber, have recently committed to shift to 100% electric vehicle fleets by 2030.decisions that automotive leadership teams make in the coming months will be critical to determining their future competitiveness. and with several routes to choose from, no single company can afford to win every battleground alone. but there are a few practical things that oems can do now to 1electric and autonomous vehicles: the future is now reorienting itself for the reality of the impending ev- and av-driven future. it starts with assessing the opportunities, determining where to play, and making the right investment trade-offs and partner-ships to stay competitive in their chosen space. ramping up the ev timeline it's a rare executive or board that hasn2019t struggled with the questions of betting on new technologies: will the new technology fully catch on? when will it be scalable and profitable?leadership teams that have identified the turning point for evs2014the threshold at which a niche market begins scaling rapidly until it reaches saturation know that the time to invest is now. according to bain analysis, global ev adoption will rapidly increase as prices decrease over the next two to eight years, reaching a turning point in 2024 . there are several influential factors at play here. one is the need for a more robust charging infrastructure. for german drivers, the days of anxiously planning trips around the location of charging stations will soon be gone. however, there are still hurdles to be tackled in terms of everyday charging conveniences, such as the lack of availability in rural areas and a transparent, comprehensive payment method. and china has quickly become a front-runner in infrastructure, with more than 1.5 times as many stations than europe and the us combined. 1: electric vehicles will reach a turning point by 2024 , 2 : electric and autonomous vehicles: the future is now but customer acceptance will be one of the largest determining factors. over the past few years, government incentives have powered the growth in ev popularity. in norway where ev drivers enjoy tax incentives, the ability to drive in bus lanes and exemptions from ferry fares, evs already make up almost half of newly registered vehicles. us car buyers, who qualify for tax breaks at the federal, and sometimes state or local level, boosted the tesla model 3 into the ranks of the top 10 best-selling passenger cars in 2019. and much of the world is poised for dramatic change. in a bain survey of consumers from the us, germany and china, almost 50% said they are considering purchasing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (phevs) or battery electric vehicles (bevs) as their next car.even with those kinds of promising numbers, manufacturers know they are still losing money. with a small pool of customers primarily purchasing bevs via government subsidies, on average, oems are currently seeing a negative 15% margin, compared with the 5% margin of conventional power-train vehicles. nevertheless, they can2019t afford not to play, given current government mandates. as of 2020, carmakers who want to participate in china's market must earn credits equivalent to 12% of their annual output2014forcing them to meet the ev production quota or purchase credits from eco-friendly industry leaders. in california, the state legislature recently announced a bold regulation , a ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 that could prompt more climate-conscious governing bodies to follow suit. to keep up with these edicts, oems are planning to expand their battery electric vehicle portfolios extensively. led by ambitious players like volkswagen, manufacturers aim to launch more than 100 new models by 2023.powerful legislation, such as bans, could certainly contribute to ev-dominated roads in the future. but for now, in much of the world, if ev adoption is to continue accelerating and oems are to turn a sufficient profit, car buyers will need more than tax incentives. to expand the market based on consumer demand, shoppers will need to feel assured that owning an ev can cost the same as, if not less than, a gasoline-powered vehicle. this will depend on the total cost of ownership (tco).on average, in germany's compact car segment, the total cost of ownership the purchase price and operating costs of battery-powered cars is on par with comparable gasoline vehicles. for different regions around the world, the exact point in time will depend on the vehicle class, battery size and gasoline and electricity prices. it also will depend on the driver and how the vehicle is used. for a model calculation of a low-mileage driver of a compact car in germany (without incentives introduced in light of covid-19), internal combustion engine vehicles (icevs) currently cost about 8% less. but for frequent drivers, or those who travel about 15,500 miles or more per year, bevs have an estimated 9% cost advantage, because of consumption savings. consider recent commitments from amazon, ups and fedex to electrify their delivery trucks. commercial fleets are achieving tco parity due partly to their extensive mileage.3electric and autonomous vehicles: the future is now falling battery costs will help. the purchase price of compact class evs is still significantly higher than icevs2014and the battery accounts for around 30% of the manufacturing costs. however, bain forecasts battery pack costs will drop from $124 per kilowatt-hour to $100 per kilowatt-hour by 2025 (see figure 2). technology improvements and optimized production at scale will enable this step change.over the next five years, as tco reaches parity across vehicle segments and driving profi les in different regions, customer demand will pick up. but on average, oems2019 margins for bevs will remain negligible until 2025. for electric mobility to truly reach its turning point, electric cars need to be cheaper to buy than gasoline and diesel models2014without government support.the twin forces of technological advancement and new consumer demand will give the final push. beyond declining battery costs, technical optimization and the benefits of scale will pull down costs for other bev-specific components. leading oems can eventually introduce high-volume automated production. their development expenses will also drop, with less r&d investment needed for subsequent electric models.the first firms to achieve the ultimate goal2014an affordable, unsubsidized electric vehicle2014will gain a valuable competitive advantage. over time, evs will turn the same, or even higher, profit as icevs. by 2025, about 12% of all new cars sold worldwide will be fully electric.by 2040 the figure could be more than 50%.costs based on battery cells for compact vehicles with high safety standards; costs for premium vehicles will likely be about 10% higher than oems with lower fire-safety requirements due to more complex design; model assumes raw material prices will decrease from 2020. this enticing prospect has led to the foundation of a handful of start-ups, further emboldened by the successes of tesla and established manufacturers' need to stake their claim.finding the right track to autonomous vehicles for some manufacturers, the transition from gasoline-powered to electric-powered vehicles will give way to another natural transition: autonomous vehicles. while many assumed that early avs would be gasoline hybrids, recent research by carnegie mellon university suggests that energy-efficient soft-ware and aerodynamic hardware will make for more eco-friendly self-driving cars. working on these technologies in tandem could give some ev leaders a leg up in the industry's next hot battleground, where silicon valley start-ups and subsidiaries are already making steady progress.exactly when will it become normal to see driverless cars zipping down highways and through city streets? we anticipate autonomous vehicles will start to gain momentum by 2028 (see figure 3).over the next eight years, two major uses will emerge: autonomous highway driving for private vehicles, and Robo-taxi fleets for urban areas. regulations will play a substantial role in the timelines for both of these applications. it's no surprise that alphabet's waymo decided to pilot and launch its autonomous driving (ad) taxi service in arizona, which offered an av-friendly regulatory environment. much of the us, europe and china will require further legislation for widespread commercial use.what's more, customers need to feel safe. customers are currently skeptical about driving a fully autonomous car in all situations and weather conditions, without the need to intervene. their hesitancy will decrease only when more people have the opportunity to test the technology. while consumers may feel that going to work or running errands in a fully autonomous car sounds more like a scene from a sci-fi movie than a possibility for this decade, the technology is rapidly progressing.autonomous vehicles will gain momentum by 2028. waymo has completed 13,219 miles on average in an autonomous driving mode without needing manual intervention2014the most of any manufacturer, according to the california department of motor vehicles. however, there's still a ways to go: according to an analysis by allstate, the average us motorist is involved in one accident every 10 years, or 140,000 miles.it's also important to recognize that in phoenix, arizona, waymo benefits from favorable conditions beyond the regulatory environment: a dry climate year-round, well-marked lines on roads and low population density. in order to expand to key markets, automakers will need to address adverse weather conditions, nonstandard road infrastructure and better technological capabilities to ensure safety. for ad pilots to outperform the average human driver, oems also must invest in intelligent technologies that provide better decision making, detection and response to unexpected third-party behavior.current models display significant progress in these areas. however, they haven't hit every requirement for level 3 automation. level 3 vehicles can perform most driving tasks within limited conditions, but a human driver must be ready to take over the wheel when the vehicle prompts it. for example, tesla vehicles with full self-driving capability will automatically steer a vehicle toward highway interchanges and exits, but active driver supervision is required at all times.for the market to reach its turning point, vehicles will need to exhibit level 4 automation, or self-driving without human interaction under certain conditions. many traditional manufacturers are expanding their advanced driver assistance systems and planning to launch level 4 features by 2025.avs will eventually reach the market as private vehicles, in the luxury and premium segment. offering a hands-free commute or trip, with the invaluable prospect of more time spent working or sleeping, these vehicles could make a high price worthwhile for many consumers. by 2030, in some regions, we expect 4% to 9% of new cars sold will be equipped with level 4 automation the majority of which will be private vehicles offering highway assistance. cost, of course, will be a significant hurdle for avs. but they won't offer benefits only to individual, time-strapped consumers. robo taxis, which can eliminate drivers and the associated costs, will prove a valuable complement for public transportation in cities around the world.the cost of an autonomous system could fall by more than 85%, to around $10,000, by 2030.according to bain research, av ride-hailing services could be a profitable solution for urban mobility by 2030. innovative cities will use robo-taxi fleets to complement their existing public transportation systems, utilizing avs to cover less frequented routes, helping to relieve traffic in congested areas.high-level autonomous driving kits currently cost more than $70,000. but over time, standardization, simplification and mass production will significantly reduce the costs. the cost of an autonomous system could fall by more than 85%, to around $10,000, by 2030.with waymo offering app-based ride-sharing in phoenix, and uber and lyft benefitting from a wealth of consumer data and brand recognition, tech firms are already in a position to win this space. but oems don't have to reinvent the wheel. instead, they can form critical partnerships with tech firms and cities alike, to secure access to new technology and establish a relationship with end users. how oems can stay in the raceoems have reached a critical juncture, heightened by the pandemic. leadership teams recognize they have little or no financial cushion, and the decisions they make in the months ahead will likely deter-mine the future of the business. they also know that few if any companies currently have the resources to invest in the wealth of opportunities created by the advancement of both evs and avs.notes: public transport average of barcelona, paris, berlin, frankfurt, london and amsterdam; private vehicle average of combustion engines in germany; costs are higher for urban users due to lower mileage (an average of 6,000 miles per year) and parking fees. even those with the scale and capabilities to break into both segments will need to concentrate on areas of brand differentiation if they're to outperform formidable tech competitors. the road ahead calls for strategic trade-offs.to keep up with the pace of the market and avoid regulatory penalties, oems can take a few immediate actions for electric vehicle investments. reduce complexity and costs to manage higher costs of evs. leading automakers will reduce their product lineup and shift investments to capabilities that differentiate the brand in consumers' eyes. win new customer segments. oems can make direct connections with consumers through innovative new business models, such as subscription services. they can use other programs, like flexible leasing, to compensate for higher ev prices and reach new audiences. forge partnerships. strong partnerships can help manufacturers plan for next-gen batteries, and secure expertise in cell technology and manufacturing.leading oems can simultaneously prepare to seize opportunities and manage threats in an autonomous future.2022 define a position in the new mobility value chain. leading oems will evaluate current capabilities and determine where they can create real value whether private highway vehicles, urban ride-hailing services or ev-meets-av technology. establish points of contact to the end user. with tech firms already dominating mobility services, top manufacturers will land partnerships to gain access, shape the customer experience and reach users. secure access to level 4 technology. depending on their uses, oems will engage in partnerships early to shape the technology and minimize costs.the future of mobility is getting closer, faster than many expected in light of the pandemic. while the time frame is narrow, oems can still catch up to their competitors by creating a bold strategy and quickly executing it. 8bold ideas. bold teams. extraordinary results.bain &

Bank of England - Avoiding Economic Anxiety (Sep-20).pdf,"In his speech, the chief economist of the Bank of England gives a warning about ���contagious pessimism��� threatening the economic recovery from the Covid crisis. ���My concern at present is that good news on the economy is being crowded out by fears about the future. This is human nature at times of stress. But it can also make for an overly pessimistic popular narrative, which fosters fear, fatalism and excess caution. This is unhealthy in itself but, if left unaddressed, also risks becoming self-fulfilling���. Whilst the analysis is UK-centric, the challenges discussed are applicable to many developed economies and, potentially, are also relevant to individual businesses.","avoiding economic anxietythrough my colleague on the industrial strategy council and former chair of the lep, christine gaskell, i know the excellent work the lep does in supporting the local economy and community. that support has never been more important given the risks facing individuals, businesses and communities. given those risks, i thought i would focus today on the economic outlook in the uk, updated in the light of events since the publication of the bank's monetary policy report in august. plenty has since happened. but one factor has remained the same: the extra-ordinary degree of uncertainty about the economic outlook. that makes monitoring the economy closely, and setting policy to support it, more important than ever. at present, the largest clouds on the economic horizon in the uk come from: the effects of rising numbers of covid cases across the uk and the accompanying policy measures taken to contain them; risks to business activity and jobs in the light of these public health developments; and the effects of moving to new trading arrangements with the eu at year-end. this unholy trinity of risks give good grounds for caution. some degree of caution is desirable - in how we socialise, shop and work - to prevent the spread of this awful disease. but we need at the same time to prevent healthy caution morphing into fear and fatalism. pessimism can be as contagious as the disease - and as damaging to our economic fortunes. avoiding economic anxiety is crucial to support the on-going recovery. this has important implications for how businesses and policymakers act and communicate. the fall and rise of the uk economy let me start by running through the fortunes of the economy so far this year. the early months saw a collapse in uk economic activity unprecedented in its speed and scale a fall in gdp of around a quarter in a matter of weeks. this recession was unique in its source as well as its speed and scale. an extreme shock to public health required extreme public health measures, restricting the flow of goods, services and people. large parts of the economy were, in effect, put into a policy-induced coma. the resulting collapse in aggregate demand would ordinarily have resulted in huge numbers of job losses. economists call the relationship between demand and jobs okun's law.historically, the okun coefficient is found to lie around 0.5-0.6. on that basis, the 25% fall in output would have been expected to lower employment by perhaps 12-15% and to raise the unemployment rate by maybe 10 percentage points, taking the pool of unemployed workers to around 5 million. the government's job support packages, notably the coronavirus job retention scheme (cjrs), avoided this catastrophic outcome. the cjrs provided support to around 9 million workers at its peak, in addition to which income support was provided to around 2 million self-employed workers. currently, it is estimated that around 2.75 million workers remain on furlough. the cjrs will end next month, to be replaced with the job support scheme (jss) announced by the chancellor last week. of course, not all jobs have or could have been protected. data from the ons's labour force survey (lfs) is, at present, difficult to interpret when gauging employment trends. but based on hmrc data on paid employees, around 700,000 workers may have been laid-off, in addition to around 280,000 self-employed workers. that means around 1 million workers in total may so far have lost their jobs. this figure, more than any other, underlines the gravity of the shock the uk economy has faced this year. the better news is that the economy began its recovery from this dramatic fall earlier, and has since recovered far-faster, than anyone expected. the speed and scale of the uk's recovery has surprised to the upside, persistently and significantly, for at least the past four months. back in may, the bank expected gdp to be around 18% below its pre-covid level on average during the third quarter. consensus forecasts by professional economists were, at the time, weaker still. four months on, we now expect gdp to be around 3-4% below its pre-covid level by the end of the third quarter. in other words, the economy has already recovered just under 90% of its earlier losses. having fallen precipitously by 20% in the second quarter, we expect uk gdp to have risen by a vertiginous 20% in the third quarter by some margin its largest-ever rise. put differently, since may uk gdp has been rising, on average, by around 1.5% per week. the pace of recovery has varied, starting slowly in may, picking up pace rapidly during june and july and is then expected to have slowed a little during august and september. even if our gdp nowcasts for august and september come to pass, there remains an average recession-sized gap between output and its pre-covid level. nonetheless, had this economic outcome been offered as a forward contract in the early summer months, absolutely everyone would have been a buyer. so what explains this faster-than-expected recovery? and, crucially, will it persist in the face of the unholy trinity of risks from covid, unemployment and brexit that potentially lie in store? these are related questions because behaviours exhibited by households and businesses so far are likely to be revealing about what impact future risks might have. habits tend to persist. that means, for all the uncertainty about the outlook, the uk's recent economic performance does offer some signal about the future outlook. the simplest explanation for the upside surprises to uk activity over recent months would be that lockdown measures have been released sooner and faster than expected. but the pace of release from lockdown in the uk has in fact been broadly in line with what the bank had expected in may. the biggest surprise has been the robustness of peoples spending behaviour in the face of lockdown constraints and other risks, not the evolution of these constraints and risks per se. the behaviour of uk consumers has been most surprising. based on our suite of fast indicators, uk consumption has been rising by, on average, around 2% per week since may.as best we can tell, consumer spending now stands at around pre-covid levels. in other words, consumption has fully recovered more than a year earlier than the bank expected as recently as august. large-ticket purchases, such as cars and houses, are also back to around pre-covid levels. against a backdrop of more than 40,000 covid-related deaths, an extra 1 million people unemployed and perhaps a quarter of the workforce having faced a cut in their incomes, the speed and scale of this recovery in consumption is, i think, fairly remarkable. it suggests considerable resilience on the part of consumers in the face of adversity. it also indicates considerable flexibility in both how and on what they spend. on the how, uk consumers have (perhaps unsurprisingly) switched from the high street online to meet their spending needs. online spending has jumped from 20% to almost 27% of overall spending during the course of this year, peaking at a third of all spending in may. it seems probable some of this switch online will endure into the future. online habits tend to persist. on the what, there have been notable switches in expenditure patterns in the face of new working and socialising patterns . according to data from visa, on average this year spending on hotels and accommodation is down by over 40% and on travel by over 35%. by contrast, spending on households goods is up 8% and food spending is up by over 25%. home production and home consumption has surged to counterbalance the effects of reduced time and money spent away from the home.  if more people work from home, travel spending is likely to be permanently lower and office equipment spending permanently higher. other spending switches are likely to reflect pent-up demand and prove temporary 2013 for example, on household goods, cars and houses. nonetheless, with cumulative spending this year still running significantly below last year's levels 2013 for houses and cars, 20-40% below 2013 considerable pent-up demand remains. an interesting case study in consumer resilience comes from restaurant spending. peak to trough, this fell over 90% as restaurants closed. as they re-opened in july, restaurant spending picked-up, if initially slowly.  in surveys at the start of august, almost half of consumers said they felt very or quite uncomfortable about visiting a restaurant. that suggested considerable caution about eating-out, with many consumers seemingly putting a high price on personal safety. the government's eat out to help out scheme provided a capped subsidy to eating-out during august. by the end of the month, it had supported 100 million meals across the uk. the scheme also provided an interesting test-bed for answering the question: what price do people put on overcoming their caution about visiting a restaurant? at 22, the answer was strikingly low. the economic news has not all been positive. job losses have continued to mount. and the recovery in consumer spending has not been matched among businesses. business surveys suggest investment is still 20-30% below its pre-covid level and online job vacancies are around 45% lower. for the worst-affected sectors, such as retail, hospitality and culture, the situation is weaker-still. where next for the economy? the key question, at this juncture, is what happens next? will the positive momentum of the past few months continue or was this a false dawn? will the resilience of the consumer, or the reticence of companies, win out? is the economic glass nine-tenths full or one tenth empty? such is the uncertainty, it would be imprudent to make confident predictions about the shape of the recovery from here - which is one reason why, contrary to some commentary, i have not done so. recovering the final few percentage points of lost output was always certain to be the hardest. adding to that difficulty, storm clouds have recently begun re-gathering over the recovery. the three darkest of these clouds come from the rising number of covid infections and the accompanying re-tightening of some lockdown restrictions across the uk; the threat from further job losses, including from the closure of the cjrs; and the risks from the transition to the uk's new trading arrangements with the eu at year-end. all three of these risks - the unholy trinity - are clear and present dangers to the uk's recovery. they are the reason why, in its august projections, the mpc included a significant downside skew to demand. at the same time, these risks need to be put in proportion and in context. while recognising their gravity, my concern is that perceptions of these risks among household and businesses are, at present, exaggerated. by creating excess caution, this has the potential to restrain unnecessarily the recovery. levels of anxiety among the general public ratcheted-up dramatically in march and april, by a factor of two-thirds. despite falling gradually, anxiety has remained at elevated levels, a third above pre-covid levels . measures of confidence among businesses and households have followed a similar pattern, spiking sharply downwards and largely remaining at those low levels, despite the sharp economic recovery. this suggests a persistent, and perhaps puzzling, degree of pessimism.consumer confidence survey, lloyds business barometer note: headline consumer confidence is based on the average of five survey balances: general macroeconomic situation over the past 12 months and expectations for the next 12 .quarterly data to march 2020 and weekly data thereafter the failure of consumer confidence to recover is particularly striking, given the complete recovery in consumption by households over the same period. put differently, the historical correlation between consumer confidence and spending appears to have broken down . a wedge has emerged between peoples' expectations and their spending, between their risk perceptions and economic reality. the same is true, to a somewhat lesser extent, among businesses. for households, that wedge might have arisen because of fears about future unemployment or inflation. past experience suggests peoples' perceptions are sensitive to these macro-economic factors which is why economists sometimes combine the two in a so-called misery index.3 (economics is not called the dismal science for nothing.) if you plot this index over time, and project it into the future using the bank's most recent forecasts, two features stand out . first, by the end of this year the misery index will have risen to around 8%, over two percentage points higher than at the start of the year. economically, this is a significant rise. but, second, in the historical scheme of things this move is nonetheless fairly modest and the level of misery, comparatively-speaking, percentage point difference on percentage change on retail sales (lhs) remains fairly low. the misery index also suggests some wedge has opened up between public perceptions and policymaker expectations for the economy. notes: index is summation of the unemployment rate and inflation rate. forecast is based on projections in aug 2020 monetary policy report. notes: headline consumer confidence is based on the average of five survey balances: general macroeconomic situation over the past 12 months and expectations for the next 12 if the public do have an exaggerated sense of the risks they face, what might be its source? psychological studies suggest it may reflect behavioural biases inherited from our hunter-gatherer past. humans tend to over-estimate systematically risks that are systemic or existential to lives and livelihoods. this dread risk causes excessively cautious behaviour, sometimes with harmful side-effects as when the exaggerated fear of flying after 9/11 caused more people to drive.these exaggerated risk perceptions are often amplified by others words and actions. caution is contagious. what often then emerges is a popular narrative. these narratives have been found to be an important driver of collective behaviour in financial markets and the economy. behavioural biases at times of existential risk, spreading contagiously, can result in pessimistic popular narratives detached from reality. at times of stress, a global game of chinese whispers can generate unduly negative expectations.i think the prevailing popular economic narrative, among businesses and households currently, is unduly negative. it has emphasized recession and risk over recovery and resilience. it has resulted in good economic news (of which there has been plenty) being discounted too readily, and fearfulness about the future being accentuated. let me give a few simple examples. chart 5 plots a simple google search of the relative incidence of two words recession and recovery; it is an economic pessimism ratio. before the covid crisis, the pessimism ratio was steady. as the crisis struck there was a predictable and sizable spike upwards, by a factor of roughly 8. since then the ratio has fallen somewhat, as we might expect as the economy has moved from recession to recovery. the dynamics of this sentiment indicator are nonetheless revealing. the drift down in the ratio has been very gradual. it remained elevated well after economic recovery had commenced and recession ceased. even now, four or five months into recovery, recession is out-googling recovery by a factor of 15 to one, above its pre-covid level. the prevailing popular narrative on the economy has remained recessionary.  a particularly revealing episode is associated with the notable spike in the pessimism ratio on the 12 august. this was when the office for national statistics published second quarter gdp figures for the uk. these showed a huge fall of over 20% in gdp, the largest quarterly fall on record by far. this, understandably, was one of the top three new stories on the day. yet the irony is that the only news in this release was gdp growth for the month of june, the final month of the quarter. this saw an almost 9% rise in activity, by far the largest rise in any month ever and above market expectations. yet negative media headlines outnumbered positives by many multiples. positive economic news was media-filtered into an extreme negative event. this filtering of good news, and accentuation of the bad, is a familiar pattern of human behaviour at times of stress and uncertainty. psychologists call it catastrophizing  discounting the best and fixating on the worst, whatever the balance of risks. it is a well-known problem among people suffering anxiety or depression. economy-wide, the result has been collective dread risk, fanned by contagious pessimism. there is some evidence of a detachment from fundamentals in the behaviour of financial markets too. pre-covid, all three market prices, interest rates, equities and the exchange rate, were sensitive to macro news. since covid, this relationship has disappeared. financial markets, recently, have detached from economic fundamentals. financial market sensitivity to economic news 3 year sterling interest rates sterling eri ftse all-share , reuters tick data from refinitiv and bank calculations. the role of policy there is another reason why people may, at present, have an exaggerated sense of anxiety. the risks they face (to health, jobs and brexit) are perceived to be beyond their control. it is well-known that events perceived to be uncontrollable add to anxiety. indeed, anxiety can itself generate perceptions that events are beyond your control, contributing to fatalism about the future and excess levels of caution.7 yet the risks facing individuals, businesses and the economy at present are, at least to some degree, within our control, collectively if not individually. all of these risks can be mitigated, if not eliminated entirely, by the actions of individuals, businesses and policymakers. one safeguard against these risks comes from our individual actions when we socialise, shop and work. a further, collective, source of insurance comes from  public health policy, fiscal policy and monetary policy. extra-ordinary action has been taken on all three fronts during the covid crisis to contain risks to the public, businesses and the economy. as importantly, it has been made clear that further action would be taken on all three fronts where risks to re-escalate. taking the three largest risks in turn, on public health there has been a worrying rise in covid cases across the uk recently. in response, a sequence of local lockdown measures have been put in place and last week these were accompanied by some tightening of national restrictions. while it is too early to judge what economic impact these measures will have, they are likely to restrain economic activity and slow growth. at the same time, it is important to put the likely impact of these measures in proportion. while the impact on individual businesses may be large, their direct impact on aggregate activity is likely to be modest. the measures affect only a sub-set of spending, notably hospitality (7% of total consumption) and work-related travel (also 7%). if both categories were to fall to their levels at the start of summer, as lockdown began to be eased, this would take a little over 3% off levels of consumption in the fourth quarter and 2% off gdp. but there are good reasons to think this is likely to be a significant over-estimate. measures announced so far are nothing like as severe as earlier in the year. even during that earlier period, we saw significant substitution between spending categories, partially insulating aggregate spending. in this respect, it is notable how quickly spending in the worst covid-affected us states bounced back recently following their second wave. of course, it is possible the indirect effects of lockdown measures hit spending harder. the most important of those effects would arise if they caused a further significant dip in consumer and/or business confidence. but that rather underscores my central point the importance of avoiding over-pessimistic commentary on the economic outlook which fuels anxiety, heightens caution and risks becoming self-fulfilling. on the risks to jobs, this is clearly real and it is very likely further losses lie ahead. in its august projections, the mpc expected unemployment to rise to around 7.5% (or 2 million people) by the end of the year. on that assumption, around two-thirds of the net job losses from the covid crisis have already occurred, with a further 500,000 losses expected in the remainder of the year. that unemployment projection, while necessarily very uncertain, flowed from an assumption that uk output would be around 5.4% below pre-covid levels by year-end.8 with an okun coefficient of around 0.6, that translated into a rise of unemployment of 3-3.5 percentage points. in the august projections, this took unemployment from its pre-covid level of 4% to around 7-7.5% at its year-end peak. 8 corrected 1 october 2020 from 7% in the initial publication. since then, there have been three significant pieces of news about the jobs outlook. first, output has continued to recover faster than expected. by the end of q3, output is now expected to be only around 3-4% below its pre-covid level. other things equal, this lowers risks to the mpc's unemployment projections. second, acting in the opposite direction, there are downside risks to this output projection as we move into the fourth quarter due to the new lockdown measures and any future measures. the third piece of significant news is the announcement of the government's new jss last week, which provides wage subsidies to workers returning on reduced hours for a six month period. with details still to be finalised, it is too early to reach quantitative conclusions on the impact of the jss. the direction of its impact is clear, however, reducing risks to unemployment relative to the bank's august projections which assumed no successor scheme. the balance of these effects on jobs is unclear. surveys of employment expectations among households and businesses are at low levels. for example, households expectations are consistent with a rise in unemployment to around 8 or 9%, at least a percentage point higher than the mpc's august projections. this is another example of the wedge between public and policymaker expectations. it also means households and businesses would be positively surprised if the mpc's projections were to materialise. the third of the unholy trinity of risks,brexit is in some ways the hardest of all to judge. it too, though, is a controllable risk, at least to some degree, by businesses and policymakers. whatever the final outcome of the trade negotiations, it is clear the uk will be leaving the customs union with the eu at the end of the year. doing so in a way that reduces operational frictions in trade, and hence costs for the economy, will require intensive preparatory work by the government and businesses. existing surveys suggest many firms still have a distance to travel before they are fully prepared for leaving the customs union with the eu, understandably so given the disruption caused by covid. but there is still time for this operational work to be done and it will be important businesses prioritise that in the weeks ahead to minimise disruption to their businesses and the economy. i am confident uk companies will rise to this challenge, as they have to the challenge of covid. let me say a final word on monetary policy. the mpc has already taken extraordinary monetary policy action in the face of the covid crisis, reducing bank rate by 65 basis points and expanding qe by a further 3300 billion. through its forward guidance, the mpc has made clear that it will not tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence of progress being made towards reducing unemployment and returning inflation to target on a sustainable basis. the mpc has also made clear that it stands ready to take whatever further action is needed to support the economy and return inflation sustainably to target, should that prove necessary. alongside public health and 12 all speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @boe_pressoffice 12 fiscal measures, this forms part of the on-going economy-wide insurance policy put in place during the covid crisis. that insurance policy should be a source of confidence and comfort for companies and households with understandable concerns about their businesses and jobs. at its meeting earlier this month, mpc decided no further monetary policy action was needed to achieve its statutory objectives. the mpc's minutes also explained that the bank would be taking forward operational work to assess the feasibility of implementing negative interest rates, should this be required in future. commencing that operational work underlines the mpc's commitment to having negative rates as a potential tool in the monetary policy toolbox. some commentators have interpreted the start of this work as conveying a signal about the likelihood of the mpc introducing negative rates in the near-term. the minutes contained no such signal. the operational work necessary to assess the feasibility of negative rates is likely to take a number of months. after that work is complete, judgements on negative rates will depend on the economic outlook at the time and in particular on whether that necessitates further monetary stimulus. if that condition was satisfied, any decision on negative rates would then depend on whether the balance of costs and benefits from using this tool was positive and whether this cost/benefit balance favoured negative rates over other monetary tools. all three of these conditions would need to be satisfied before negative rates became a reality. at present, none of those conditions is in my view satisfied. conclusions the economy faces uncertainties that are extraordinarily large and risks that are skewed to the downside. in this environment, caution is natural and understandable. it is important policymakers are vigilant to these risks and uncertainties and responsive to them with their policy actions. it is important they provide, as they have so far, economy-wide insurance to support businesses and households during these troubled times. that has been the approach of the mpc so far and it will continue to be its approach if new risks arise. at the same time, it is important the unexpectedly positive progress the economy has made so far this year is not overlooked. the economy has recovered further and faster, and has shown far-greater robustness and resilience, than anyone expected. this positive news has received less attention than it deserves, both on its own terms and because of what it may tell us about the economy's resilience to future shocks. my concern at present is that good news on the economy is being crowded-out by fears about the future. this is human nature at times of stress. but it can also make for an overly-pessimistic popular narrative, which fosters fear, fatalism and excess caution. this is unhealthy in itself but, if left unaddressed, also risks becoming self-fulfilling. i have a rooseveltian fear of fear itself if the economy were sat on a psychiatrist's sofa, the diagnosis would not be especially difficult. a propensity to dismiss good news and dwell on bad? to catastrophize about the future? the sense of events being beyond our control? these are the psychological symptoms of anxiety. and collective anxiety is as contagious, and could be as damaging to our well-being, as this terrible disease. averting an economic anxiety attack calls for a balanced and flexible approach to the words and actions of businesses and policymakers. planning for the worst is important, but needs to be accompanied by hope for the best. encouraging news about the present needs not to be drowned out by fears for the future. now is not the time for the economics of chicken licken. that means balance in how the economic outlook is described, acknowledging good news as well as bad, contemplating upside as well as downside scenarios, taking positive signals (as well as some comfort) from the resilience shown so far. this is not boosterism; it is balance, at a time when behavioural biases and pessimistic popular narratives offer an unbalanced lens on the economy.

BCG - COVID Leading to Permanent Increase in eCommerce Deliveries  (Jul-20).pdf,"The COVID-19 crisis will drive a permanent increase in e-commerce, with real consequences for online companies, brick-and-mortar rivals and logistic companies delivering the purchases. Residential package deliveries have strong growth, but more profitable B2B deliveries are down significantly. As a result, market capitalizations of main players  including DHL, FedEx, and UPS  declined 15%-30% from January to mid-May. Going forward, the e-commerce surge will challenge those unprepared for rapid volume increases. BCG suggests that companies adapt by implementing creative delivery methods, create 360-degree visibility into operations, and create a personal connection with consumers.","can delivery companies keep up with the post- covid-19 e-commerce boom? unsurprisingly, the covid-19 crisis has led to a big increase in e-ccommercearound the world. wary consumers, many in lockdown, have been turning to online shopping in large numbers: during the third week of march, for example, e-commerce sales in the us were 58% higher than during the same period in 2019. perhaps more telling, 20% of consumers in the us said that, over the previous 30 days, they had ordered groceries online for the first time ever.we expect the shift to e-commerce to become permanent, with real consequences not just for online companies and their physical rivals but also for the companies that deliver all those purchases to homes and businesses. right now, e-commerce-driven residential package deliveries are going strong, but more profitable b2b deliveries are down significantly, and increased costs to protect workers and customers have lowered profitability even further. going forward, the surge in e-commerce may be challenging for delivery companies that are unprepared for rapid increases in volume and shifts in business models. but companies that can adapt to the new reality will benefit. turnaround time commerce had been growing impressively even before the onset of the pandemic. from 2017 to 2019, global growth in e-ccommerce sales outperformed brick-and-mortar sales by a factor greater than 10, and retail sales online were expected to rise from just 12% in 2017 to $6.5 trillion, or 22% of total retail sales, by 2023. several major economies have adopted e-commerce with enthusiasm, including china, south korea, and the uk; but large developing markets, including brazil, india, and russia, remain underpenetrated. even in the us, the world's largest economy, online sales had not reached 20% of the total before the pandemic, with such major retail categories as personal care, drugs and medical supplies, and food and drink notably lagging. but that's all changed, the impact of covid-19 on the global economy has been swift, although it varies considerably from industry to industry. in the us, for example, entertainment outside the home, along with travel and tourism, is currently down by at least 90%, while grocery sales are up by more than 20% and e-commerce by more than 50%, as a reult, market capitalization for amazon, the largest e-commerce player by far, has increased by more than 25% since the end of january. and first-quarter 2020 global revenues at shopify, a canadian provider of e-commerce services, grew by almost 250% compared with the same period in 2019. in the us, the increase in online shopping has led to booming sales in such categories as groceries, electronics, health care products, and toys, while clothing, sports and outdoor equipment, and other nonessential goods have suffered. lasting effects but will the big uptick in e-commerce activity continue once the covid-19 crisis ends? thanks to the new buying habits that cconsumers are forming now, and the ways that businesses are adapting in response, we believe the answer to be a resounding yes, for several reasons.existing customers are increasing the frequency of online purchases, and new customers are buying online for the first time. as of mid-march, half of the consumers in china, for example, had already purchased more goods online than they had in all of february. half of the consumers in the us said that they bought groceries online in march because of covid-19 and approximately one-fifth of them did so for the first time. in italy, the number of carrefour's online customers has doubled since the country's lockdown began on march 9.as more and more consumers discover the convenience of e-commerce, concerns about product quality and security will likely dissipate. consumers have long preferred to judge the quality and freshness of the groceries they buy in person; that will change, now that so many are getting used to the convenience of food delivery. target, a us department store chain, reports higher levels of spending and loyalty among its new online customers. and the introduction and use of mobile apps tracing the progress of the covid-19 outbreak have shown that personal data can be used and stored safely, removing concerns about the security of online shopping.another factor lies in the sheer number of retail stores likely to close as a result of the pandemic, making it that much harder to purchase goods offline. experience in china has already shown that even after the lockdown there lifted, consumers are not rushing back to physical shops. this will force all kinds of businesses to reinvent themselves online. chinese retailer jd.com, which sells both online and in physical stores, is partnering with consumer brands to offer promotions and extending same-day delivery to smaller cities and other new markets. uber eats and deliveroo are rapidly recruiting new restaurants to their delivery services. and even categories that are already doing well online in certain markets, such as fashion in the uk, will likely reach levels that are higher still.our analysis of four key consumer categories food and beverage, drugs and medical supplies, personal care, and pet products2014suggests that online sales as a percentage of the total will continue to grow far faster than pre pandemic estimates, even after the crisis ends. sales of food and beverage products online, still just 3% of the total, are likely to make the most gains2014a major shift, given the sheer size of the market. but we estimate that even online sales of pet products, already 20% of the market, may grow to as much as 39% over the next two years. (see exhibit 4.)in short, the pandemic will bring major increases in online penetration to virtually every product category, no matter how large the online sales are now. the shipping news despite the increase in business for e-commerce, the key sector on which it de-pends2014the delivery companies2014have struggled. the market capitalizations of many of the largest companies including deutsche post dhl (dpdhl), fedex, and ups have declined by 15% to 30% from january to mid-may, significantly more than the 12% decline in the s&p 500 index over the same period.the reasons aren2019t hard to find. every ele-ment of the global transportation network has been under siege over the past few months because of the covid-19 crisis. right now, most ocean cargo, for example, has been rerouted around asia; shipping capacity on routes between asia and north america was down 26% in march, compared with last year; and ships leaving chinese ports are at as little as 10% capacity. lost trips due to reductions in asia-to-eu-rope shipping routes has also led to lost revenue from return trips, negatively impacting the financials of the ocean cargo transporters even further.every major airline has shut down routes and other aspects of their operations. multiple us and international airlines have suspended or reduced all passenger flights to china, europe, japan, and elsewhere: 1 million commercial passenger flights have been canceled through june 30. fully half of the global air fleet and 30% of the global air cargo fleet have been grounded, resulting in a severe shortage in airfreight capacity and quadrupling the costs to as much as $1 million per day for one-way charters of full freighters. to make up for the added costs, some inter continental express companies are imposing temporary surcharges on customers and shutting down select routes entirely. meanwhile, several passenger airlines, including american airlines and korean air, are converting some of their otherwise grounded planes to cargo-only carriers and delivering critical medical supplies, food-stuffs, and other essential goods. the impact on individual companies has varied, as have their responses: 2022 the us postal service announced that the sudden drop in mail volume has led to a severe cash crisis. it expects to run out of cash by september 30 without further financial assistance from the government and predicts a near-term, pandemic-related loss of $13 billion, which is expected to rise to $22 billion over the next 18 months. as a result, it has asked the government for $75 billion through a combination of cash, grants, and loans to avoid a liquidity crisis in the fall. 2022 overall, dpdhl remained profitable in the first quarter of 2020, but surging growth in e-commerce parcels was offset by a double-digit reduction in mail volume. as a result, the company's first-quarter earnings declined by $260 million, $100 million of which came out of the operating profits in its express division. the ongoing uncertainty forced the company to withdraw its earnings forecast for 2020. it also delayed payment of dpdhl's annual dividend to conserve cash needed to fund its german postal operations and to meet the higher-capacity requirements for e-commerce parcels. also it stopped shipping small parcels from germany and other european countries to brazil, china, north america, and elsewhere, and is charging businesses an international crisis surcharge of 16 per package shipped to the us. 2022 like dpdhl, fedex has stopped issuing earnings forecasts and is taking measures to protect its cash flow and liquidity. to that end, it has borrowed $1.5 billion to build up its cash reserves, stepped up ongoing cost reduction measures, and introduced temporary surcharges on all international packages and airfreight shipments. meanwhile, higher demand for fedex ground retail deliveries has been offset by weak demand for global b2b transportation, forcing the company to reexamine its overall operations. 2022 several carriers, including fedex, ups, and dpd uk, have imposed temporary surcharges on packages sent to select destinations to partially offset increases in transportation costs due to the severe shortage of intercontinental air capacity. and amazon has suspended delivery of items from its third-party e-commerce partners entirely. some companies, however, are thriving. the market capitalization of sf holding, a chinese delivery company with no real competition in its home territory, has risen by almost 50% since the beginning of the pandemic. its business model is focused almost exclusively on e-commerce, and its delivery volume rose by more than 40% in january, the first month of the covid-19 crisis in china. what to do now sf holdings, however, is an exception. few other companies have been able to benefit from the nearly 60% rise in e-commerce over the past few months; indeed, their capacity has been reduced, revealing gaps in their delivery networks. on the business side, for example, grocers are blaming their distributors and the delivery companies with which they work for the shortage of vehicles, drivers, and workers, and the lack of adequate storage space, resulting in more empty shelves. what's more, the rapid rise in residential demand is proving to be economically challenging for deliverers that must rebalance their operations away from more profitable business delivery.several delivery companies are already taking steps to rethink their operations and revive their short-term fortunes. as noted above, some companies including amazon, fedex, and dpdhl are adjusting their agreed-upon service levels; increasing shipping time estimates for some customers, depending on the nature of the products ordered; and temporarily suspending service in some locations, depending on the severity of the pandemic. they are also boosting the use of warehouse robotics to streamline and speed up order fulfillment. furthermore, and in addition to amazon, others including alibaba and jd.com are also hiring employees from other sectors, setting up online job-sharing plat-forms to attract unemployed workers, and increasing pay for warehouse and delivery workers2014by as much as $2 an hour in the case of amazon. alibaba and sf express are also turning to robotics to streamline warehouse operations and speed up order fulfillment. to manage the rise in complaints about delayed and missing packages, companies are shifting away from call centers and partnering with consumer brands and restaurants to improve their chat and other online customer service methods. all delivery companies are taking safety precautions and increasing hygiene in operations forgoing routine signatures for package delivery, regularly sanitizing delivery equipment, and adjusting processes and training employees and third parties to comply with safety requirements.in hopes of maintaining, and potentially expanding, operations during the current crisis, delivery players can boost their advantage in several ways: 2022 creative delivery methods. expand the use of noncontact delivery methods, such as lockers and pickup points. ensure real-time tracking and communication with customers to help minimize disruptions. 2022 control tower for rapid response. set up a rapid response unit with 360-degree visibility into operations to provide reliable information to customers. plan joint business operations with key clients to ensure closer coordination with customers. 2022 talent upgrade and qualification. take advantage of the market down-turn to fill positions in strategic areas, such as it. develop structured temporary hiring programs to respond better to surges in demand. implement programs to qualify employees to work not only during the crisis but also after it is over. 2022 dynamic pricing. analyze capacity constraints and their impact on service levels, and use dynamic pricing strategies to smooth supply chain bottlenecks during the crisis. 2022 personal connection with consumers. develop a personal connection with consumers, allowing them to set up preferences and inform them of good delivery practices. educate them about the safety and convenience of online shopping and delivery. the recovery process in just a few months, the covid-19 pandemic has transformed how we live, work, and shop2014at least for the time being. as of now, it's unclear which changes will prove to be the longest lasting. there's no doubt, however, that the impact on e-commerce will linger far into the future. the choice, convenience, and immediacy offered by online shopping have proved essential to consumers around the world and will likely accelerate its acceptance in virtually every product category.the impact on delivery companies, however, has been mixed, with many struggling to keep up with the increased volume amid major challenges to their operations. yet they, too, will recover and benefit from the increasing shift to e-commerce. to get ready for this new world, they must expand their operations, improve their logistics technology, and increase their efforts to boost efficiency through automation."
BCG - The End of Single Occupancy Vehicles (Dec-20).pdf,"Forward-looking urban mobility systems have two primary goals: expand access for all residents and ending the supremacy of Single Occupancy Vehicles. To establish a baseline for urban transportation and mobility improvements, BCG used a location-based approach to create the Accessibility Index that measures mobility performance across cities and access to opportunities within a city. Accessibility varies widely, even among large, developed Western cities. For example, 41% of Berlins inhabitants can be reached within 60 minutes using public transit, but the same metric is just 7% in Miami.","End the reign of single-occupancy vehicles for greater urban access. cities with forward-looking mobility systems have two big, primary goals: to expand access for all residents and to end the supremacy of single-occupancy vehicles (sovs). when access is easy, convenient, and equitable, cities gain in wealth and the well-being of residents. and when most travel doesn't mean one person traveling alone in a car, especially a gasoline-powered car, cities are less congested, less polluted, and less likely to perpetuate patterns that deny certain residents and neighborhoods access to jobs and other opportunities. these words variously attributed to either gustavo petro or enrique pefalosa, both former mayors of bogote are a veritable urban mobility proverb: a developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. it's where the rich use public transport.imagine the gains in economic opportunity and social integration, healthier air, and travel time saved, but questions remain: is it possible to achieve both economic growth and greater equity? to ensure people's freedom of movement while working together to save the planet? to preserve a city's character and plan for the future? our research explored these choices.the goals are lofty yet vital for the future well-being of cities. as a starting point for improving urban transportation and mobility, we have built the bcg accessibility in-dex to measure mobility performance across cities and to provide a detailed view of the mobility patterns within a city's borders. these insights can help leaders identify the issues unique to their city and implement the solutions most likely to yield greater wealth and health. in this article, we explain the index, the issues, and the initiatives that cities must undertake.a new measure of mobility our objective was to assess the performance of mobility systems by measuring access to opportunities within a city using a location-based approach. our two main guidelines: the measure should be easy to understand, and it should allow a meaningful comparison between cities around the world and among areas within cities, regardless of the mobility modes available. we defined two metrics:  a zone accessibility index. this shows, for a given urban zone or subzone, the percentage of the city's inhabitants and of jobs in the metropolitan area that can be reached within a certain amount of time (for example, 30 or 60 minutes) using a car or public transit at peak travel times. a city accessibility index. this is the average of the accessibility indexes of all the zones or subzones, weighted by the population of each one. it measures the percentage of the city's inhabitants and of jobs in the metropolitan area that can be reached within a certain amount of time on average per inhabitant. our accessibility index relies on a unique assemblage of public and private data. we used population and job location data from offices of national statistics, and we simulated travel times by leveraging both apis from private sources and general transit feed specification (gtfs) data from various public transport operators. accessibility varies widely even among large, developed cities which focuses on advanced analytics and data science, we developed an algorithm that, when applied to the proprietary dataset, allows us to capture the performance of the road infrastructure (for cars but excluding buses) and of the public-transport infrastructure (trains, subways, buses) in an urban area, with a precise mechanism designed to track the time it takes to reach other areas and jobs using various means of transport in and around cities. the accessibility index can also be used to measure access to resources like education and health care.our research reveals that accessibility, even among large, developed western cities, varies widely. for example, on average, someone in berlin can reach 41% of the city's in-habitants within 60 minutes using public transit, but someone in miami can access just 7% of that city's inhabitants via the same mode within the same amount of time. in addition to differences across cities, we observe large differences within cities. for example, in greater paris, people in areas with the greatest accessibility can reach approximately 60% of others in the metropolitan area in 60 minutes using public transportation.accessibility index percentage of the city's population reachable within 60 minutes by public transport percentage of the city's population reachable within 30 minutes by car. the least accessibility can reach only about 25% within the same time frame.for cities with available job location data, we can also map access to jobs by public transit and by car. in london, for instance, the accessibility index revealed that the wealthiest people, on average, have access to 45% of jobs in 30 minutes using the fastest mode of transportation, while the poorest people have access to only 34% of those jobs within the same time frame using the fastest mode. this type of analysis can enable public authorities to focus their trans-port development policy on the most underserved populations and areas, and thus help to provide a more egalitarian and therefore a more prosperous framework for the local economy. accessibility = wealth + equality as cities look to redesign their transportation futures, measuring urban mobility performance is a crucial first step in gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges and choices that lie ahead. the next step is to understand the impact of that performance. to do that, planners must recall the travel time budget, established in the 1970s by yacov zahavi, an israeli engineer who discovered that the amount of time people spend on travel each day is constant over time and across geographies. for generations, city inhabitants have spent a daily average of 1 hour 20 minutes in travel, with distances expanding as the means of transportation grow (with improvements to infrastructure, development of a transit network, and the recent addition of new mobility options like ride-hailing and bike and scooter rentals) and with destinations growing in number as accessibility rises.taking into account this fundamental constant, our measures of cities accessibility have brought to light two crucial findings: better transportation system performance increases the wealth of a city, and it reduces inequality within a city. because people travel the same amount of time every day, improving accessibility means that they can travel to new and more destinations every day. as a result, they will have new opportunities for jobs, education, business relationships, health care, shopping, social gatherings, and more which, in turn, will bring greater wealth and well- being to the city and to those who live and work there.  likewise, the less adequate the transit system, the larger the number of missed opportunities and the lower the quality of life.in other words, an improved transportation system creates a unique dynamic that can end the vicious circle that too often leaves poor people stuck in isolated areas, unable to reach the schools and jobs essential to lifting them out of poverty. another consideration is the shift to remote learning and working that has occurred during the covid-19 pandemic. this increase in accessibility, brought about not by improved mobility but by digitization, is likely to continue, at least to a degree. but it is not available to everyone. while it may be an option for wealthier students and white-collar workers, poorer students and blue-collar workers will still rely on mobility to bring them to school and to work.sov supremacy = congestion + pollution + inequality the third step in understanding the impact of an urban mobility system's performance is to look at the relative use and effectiveness of public transit and driving in delivering accessibility. the accessibility index shows that driving offers better access than public transit in almost every city in our study.this situation strengthens sov supremacy. and if individuals continue to travel alone in cars, traffic congestion, pollution, and the accessibility gap within urban areas will grow, especially in cities where residential areas are far from industrial and economic clusters.hope that the digital revolution would solve the accessibility-related challenges.accessible cities tend to be richer and more equal gdp per capita.gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (ppp) rates and divided by total population; an international dollar has the same purchasing power over gdp as a us dollar. faced by cities worldwide has waned. market forces and human behavior have made it hard to move away from the traditional car-centric mobility to a new, more sustainable system. the new ride-sharing services, touted as a breakthrough incentive to renounce car ownership, are building their businesses by maximizing their own assets on the ground and the number of rides that they sell. rather than contributing to better overall urban mobility, their goal is to multiply the miles covered by their participating vehicles, often at the expense of public transit. a recent study from the union of concerned scientists showed that ride-sharing companies such as uber and lyft are responsible for 70% more pollution than the personal-car trips that they dis-place. the upshot: there are more cars on the road than ever.the archetypes of urban mobility transforming the urban mobility paradigm starts with understanding the status quo. each city is different, and each transportation improvement must be adjusted to the local reality. for instance, although car use dominates in every city, its impact does not manifest in every city in the same way. we have divided the 15 cities that we mapped using the accessibility index into three distinct urban mobility archetypes. further research reveals some of the variables that underlie these archetypes, giving us a general idea of what cities are contending with and why. in some cases, we see evidence that cities efforts to control the mobility mix are paying off. it may be too early to say that these approaches are tried and true, but they certainly point the way. here's a deeper look at the three archetypes: mobility champions. berlin and madrid stand out because of the outstanding accessibility provided by both their public transit and their road infrastructure systems. this aligns with policies and initiatives that were recently established in both capital cities. berlin, which already had a dense suburban train and underground network and a strong bicycle culture,has shown its capacity for mobility innovation by regulating ride-sharing and by launching an on-demand transit service that complements public transit in the city center. madrid implemented a ban on older cars that could not meet new anti-pollution standards and restricted access to the city center to drivers with private parking spots and those who register for parking in advance. these measures have reduced congestion while increasing quality of life. mobility centrists. new york, london, paris, and rome rank high in accessibility by public transportation: 25% of the inhabitants of these cities can be reached within 60 minutes. but this masks the relatively poor access possible by car in these cities (due to inadequate road infrastructure), as well as stark inequities across neighborhoods. all of these cities have very dense centers where the wealthy live and qualified jobs are located, and there are large discrepancies in accessibility and mobility system performance between the richest and poorest areas. (see the sidebar, a closer look at mobility centrists) mobility laggards. most large north american metropolitan areas have very low public-transit accessibility, leaving their inhabitants almost completely automobile-dependent. typically, the poor performance of the public transport system in these cities provides no credible alternative to sov supremacy; as a result, these cities face very high levels of congestion and pollution, which spread into the outlying suburban areas. waging war on the single occupancy car is not an effective way out of this situation. los angeles, like california at large, has tried this approach, notably by developing an extensive network of high-occupancy-vehicle lanes. experience has shown, though, that hov lanes are underutilized and that the savings in travel time do not create a significant incentive for people to carpool. such isolated measures against sovs do not provide a sufficiently robust framework to overcome car supremacy, just as carpooling alone is not an adequate mode of urban transport but must be complemented by efficient public transit.the empty quadrant at the lower right of exhibit 3 speaks volumes. in london, access to good jobs is lower overall relative to other centrists, but the gap between the share of jobs accessible to people in the richest and poorest areas is less extreme (45% versus 34%). although new york, london, and paris rank high on public transportation accessibility, they suffer from large inequalities that force people living in the suburbs to commute to work by car. a closer look at mobility centrists on the surface, mobility centrists seem to have a high level of accessibility, but differences across neighborhoods spell discrepancies between the richest and poorest areas. in paris, for example, we found a wide disparity between the share of qualified jobs (61% versus 21%) that residents in the wealthiest and poorest areas are able to reach within 30 minutes using the fastest mode of transportation. access within a city reveals local disparities paris. impossible for a city to occupy this space, because to do so would require a web of roads occupying a great deal of public space, which would render the city devoid of character and quality of life. and though it might seem paradoxical, studies have shown that building more and bigger roads does not solve congestion problems; according to the law of induced travel demand, they simply create more space for more cars and ultimately more congestion or another victory for sovs over safer, healthier, more equitable forms of mobility.is it possible for a city to move among quadrants to improve accessibility and change the archetype to which it belongs? yes. ultimately, as part of a city's mobility strategy, a mobility laggard can become a mobility centrist, and a centrist can become a champion. how do we get there? the way to end sov supremacy: a new urban-mobility framework to transform the urban-mobility paradigm, cities need to take the lead. they must establish the right regulatory framework to enable innovative mobility solutions that increase access and thereby have positive economic, social, and environmental effects. and they must shape mobility operations, experimenting with new solutions and monitoring mobility behaviors to ensure that private operators and riders are properly incentivized to switch from individual cars to shared and green modes of transportation. in other words, local public authorities should orchestrate the whole mobility ecosystem. consider the situation of the cities that are now classified as mobility laggards. to improve their mobility performance, they must initially focus on strengthening their public-transport systems. bringing a certain level of efficiency and modernity to the infrastructure is a prerequisite, but investing massively in traditional public-transit infra-structure is probably not the most efficient way to tap the full potential of the current public network it's an expensive, lengthy, and inflexible process. building new metro lines or stations entails years of planning, negotiation, and related friction, and does not always lead to an overall increase in accessibility. instead, mobility laggards seeking to up their game and enable commuters to enjoy the full potential of the city's public transport network can make use of new options just as we have seen our mobility champions do. these options are available to all cities, but they hold particular relevance for laggards, whose first priority is to put in place alternatives to sovs. these cities can couple their efforts to emphasize public transport with the use of modes that are less costly and more nimble. for instance, they can supplement public transit with micro mobility alternatives, such as free-floating bicycles, and solutions that encourage increased utilization of vehicles on the roads, like car sharing. cities can take different approaches to develop these options. they can work together with private operators to define a target offering, or they can subsidize or facilitate the implementation of alternative modes through regulations and support of pilot initiatives. with micro-mobility, on-demand transit, and car sharing in place, any city will likely score high on the accessibility index. but that does not mean people will move away from sovs. cars could still remain the most efficient and convenient means of transport. therefore, for mobility laggards to become mobility centrists and, ultimately, mobility champions, they will have to take further steps to induce change and end sov supremacy.the challenge is twofold: to increase the cost of traveling alone in a car and to improve the attractiveness of alternative transportation modes. cities can increase the costs associated with sovs. for instance, they can institute dissuasive measures like congestion pricing and limits on the number of taxis and ride-hailing vehicles on the road. but unless alternative modes of transport are sufficiently attractive offering satisfactory speed and convenience commuters will likely opt to absorb the increased expense of travel by sov. to improve the appeal of alternatives, cities will need to work with other mobility players. it will require a fully integrated mobility-as-a-service transit system that includes a digital platform, access to the latest mobility offerings, incentives, and measurement tools to ensure that all transport services are running at full efficiency. the objective is not to build some kind of single-transport killer app but to fully integrate and orchestrate all available services, from incentives to travel planning to price to ticketing. this will involve increasing integration across the burgeoning modes of mobility and making sure that providers can collect all the data they need to establish policies and travel options that will push commuters toward more environmentally sound travel modes.while it is mainly the responsibility of public authorities to develop such a comprehensive urban mobility framework, private players, too, must understand both the value at stake and the underlying market possibilities. together, public and private operators can unlock tremendous value by creating mobility coalitions that benefit the economy and community at large. in this way, the seemingly undesirable tradeoffs that have hobbled urban accessibility efforts in the past can be productively addressed and economic growth achieved in tandem with greater equity. freedom of movement can coexist with efforts to save the planet. and a smart urban mobility framework can preserve a city's character and lay the groundwork for the future.this article is the fifth in a series on the future of mobility. in subsequent publications, we will explore other options available to cities and new-mobility operators, drawing on the findings of our research. we welcome the input and participation of cities and private players."
BFI - 60M Less Commuting Hours Per Day - How Americans Use the Time Saved (Sep-20).pdf,"The University of Chicagos Becker Friedman Institute (BFI) has been recently exploring less obvious yet important issues related to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the pivotal, long-term economic changes it may introduce. The BFI estimates that the pandemic-induced shift to working from home lowers commuting time among Americans by more than 60 million hours per workday, with cumulative time savings over the past seven months exceeding 9 billion hours. Those working from home devote most of their time savings to non-leisure activities  work for pay, chores, home improvement, and childcare. Together, these activities absorb about 60% of the time savings. The primary job absorbs the largest chunk of time savings, around 35%.","60 million fewer commuting hours per day. Drawing on original surveys of our own design, we estimate that the pandemic-induced shift to working from home lowers commuting time among americans by more than 60 million hours per work day Cumulative time savings over the past seven months exceed 9 billion hours. our survey data also say that americans devote about 35% of the time savings to their primary jobs and about 60% to work activities of all sorts, including household chores and child care. the allocation of time savings is broadly similar for men and women and across groups defined by race and ethnicity, but it differs substantially by education group and between persons with and without children at home. the covid-19 pandemic triggered a sudden, massive shift to working from home (wfh) around the world. there is great concern about how this development will play out over time, whether it will exacerbate inequalities in economic circumstances, and how the economy will adjust.on the positive side, the shift to wfh has already saved billions of hours of commuting time in the United States alone, we tap several sources, including original surveys of our own design, to quantify this time-saving aspect of the wfh shift and to develop evidence on how americans are using the time savings. over the course of may, july and august 2020, we surveyed 10,000 americans aged 20-64 years who earned at least $20,000 in 2019. figure 1 summarizes their work circumstances as of the survey date: 37.1% work from home, 34.7% work on business premises, and the rest are not working. these figures imply that wfh accounts for 52.3% of employment in the pandemic economy, similar to independent survey-based estimates, American time use survey data imply a 5.2% wfh rate among employed persons before the pandemic struck (barrero, bloom and davis, 2020). according to the current population survey, 147.2 million americans work for pay as of august 2020. according to the 2018 American community survey, workers spent an average 54 minutes per day commuting to and from work before the pandemic.Putting the pieces together, we estimate that the pandemic-induced shift to work from home yields 62.4 million fewer commuting hours per woworkdaycumulating these daily savings from mid-march to mid-september, the aggregate time savings associated with the pandemic-induced shift to wfh is more than 9 billion hours.3 how are working americans using the time saved by not commuting? to throw light on this matter, our surveys include the following question: during the covid-19 pandemic, while you have been working from home, how are you now spending the time you have saved by not commuting? a) working on your current or primary job b) working on a second or new secondary job c) childcare d) home improvement, chores, or shopping e) leisure indoors (e.g. reading, watching tv and movies) f) exercise or outdoor leisure we posed two variants of this question. the first asks persons wfh to allocate 100% of the time savings over the six activity categories, and the second asks them to select all categories to which they devote any of their time savings. for the second question variant, we assign equal percentages to each selected category.  summarizes the reported allocation of time saved by not commuting. extra time devoted to the respondent's primary job absorbs 35% of the time savings. the next largest category is indoor leisure, including reading and watching tv or movies, which absorbs 18%. childcare, outdoor leisure, and work on a second job together account for; this figure reflects employed persons 16 and older who did not work from home. if persons work 5 days per week and the daily savings in commuting time is uniform throughout the seven monthsthe time savings for employed persons is 9.4 billion hours. this figure does not include the reduction in commuting time due to the pandemic-induced drop in aggregate employment. about 30%. the picture, then, is one in which those wfh devote most of their savings in commuting time to non-leisure activities work for pay, but also chores, home improvement, and childcare. together, these activities absorb about 60% of the time savings. the primary job absorbs the largest chunk of time savings around 35% for both men and women and across groups defined by race and ethnicity. larger differences emerge when comparing respondents by education. those with a high school diploma or less schooling, devote 32% of their time saving to their primary job and nearly 15% to a second job, almost twice as much as other education groups. finally, there is a huge gap between workers who live with children and those who don't. childcare absorbs 18% of time savings among those with children. still, the primary job absorbs the largest chunk of time savings for both groups, if somewhat less (33%) for workers with children than for those without (38%). those without children also allocate about 3 additional percentage points of their time savings to outdoor leisure and chores, and over 9 additional percentage points to indoor leisure. in sum, and looking across a variety of demographic groups, americans devote one-third more of their pandemic-induced savings in commuting time to their primary jobs. leisure and household production activities absorb the rest. our surveys also include the following two questions about work hours: in 2019 (before covid) approximately how many hours a week did you work when employed? how many hours per week are you working for pay [now]? figure 4 shows average responses to these questions among person wfh during the pandemic. hours on the job for these persons average 32 per week in the pandemic economy, as compared to 36.4 in the pre-pandemic economy. this difference amounts to 38 minutes per day, less than the savings in commuting time.respondents who work from home as of the survey date, these shorter hours do not reflect persons who stopped working during the pandemic. recall that our calculation of commuting time savings is overall working persons, while our calculation of reduced hours on the job in this paragraph covers only those working from home at the survey date. those wfh devote one-third of commuting time savings to their primary job, while spending less total time in paid employment? one possibility is that, when respondents answer the question about time allocations, they consider how they use the specific time slot they once spent commuting. respondents may devote a few more minutes in the morning to chores and childcare, while still devoting about a third of their old commuting time slot to their primary job. at the end of the day, they might end somewhat early and turn on the tv. they might interrupt tv time to respond to a late afternoon or early evening work request. this interpretation is broadly consistent with media reports (e.g. jacobs, 2020), whereby some employees work longer hours from home during the pandemic, but with added flexibility to interrupt the day to care for children or perform home chores and other non-job activities. this narrative also fits with our evidence that those wfh spend more than half of their commuting time savings on non-job activities like childcare or leisure. the covid-19 pandemic is an enormous healthcare crisis and a source of tremendous hardship for many. At the same time, the pandemic-induced shift to working from home involves a huge reduction in time spent commuting. according to our evidence and calculations, the time savings are approaching ten billion hours as of mid-september for american workers alone. the global reduction in time spent commuting is surely many times larger. our survey data also say that nearly two-thirds of the savings in commuting time accrue to workers in the form of extra time for leisure and household production activities.

BFI - Why Working From Home Will Stick (Dec-20).pdf,"University of Chicago authors point to pivotal shifts in the ways of working caused by the pandemic. Key mechanisms driving changes include better-than-expected experiences working from home, diminished stigma, investments in physical and human capital enabling working from home, reluctance to return to pre-pandemic activities, and innovation supporting working from home. The result is that 22% of all full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5% before.","why working from home will stick.  abstract: we survey 15,000 americans over several waves to investigate whether, how, and why working from home will stick after covid-19. the pandemic drove a mass social experiment in which half of all paid hours were provided from home between may and october 2020. our survey evidence says that 22 percent of all full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5 percent before. we provide evidence on five mechanisms behind this persistent shift to working from home: diminished stigma, better-than-expected experiences working from home, investments in physical and human capital enabling working from home, reluctance to return to pre-pandemic activities, and innovation supporting working from home. we also examine some implications of a persistent shift in working arrangements: first, high-income workers, especially, will enjoy the perks of working from home. second, we forecast that the post-pandemic shift to working from home will lower worker spending in major city centers by 5 to 10 percent. third, many workers report being more productive at home than on business premises, so post-pandemic work from home plans offer the potential to raise productivity as much as 2.4 percent.  introduction the covid-19 pandemic has produced a massive shift to working from home. in independently conducted surveys, found that about half of all employed persons worked entirely or partly from home in may 2020. by our own estimates, about half of all paid hours were provided from home between may and october 2020. this mass experiment in working from home has, understandably, attracted tremendous interest. the frequency of newspaper articles that mention working from home in the news bank archive of around 2,000 daily us news papers rose 120-fold (12,000%) in march relative to january 2020. over the previous 20 years by contrast, coverage of working from home only doubled. this explosion in interest reflects the many questions raised by a massive shift in working arrangements and where work happens during the covid-19 pandemic. there appears to be less consensus, however, about how well working from home has worked, whether it will stick after the pandemic ends, and why or why not. this lack of consensus is evident in the wide range of views, from extremely negative to extremely positive, prominent executives have expressed about working from home. at one end of the spectrum, netflix ceo reed hastings, recently said, i don't see any positives. not being able to get together in person, particularly internationally, is a pure negative (cutter, 2020). at the other extreme, heyward donigan, ceo of retailer rite aid, reported, we have adapted to work-from-home unbelievably well we've learned that we can work remote, and we can now hire and manage a company remotely (cutter, 2020). others have expressed intermediate views, for example apple ceo tim cook: in all candor, it's not like being together physically.but i don't believe that we'll return to the way we were because we've found that some things actually work really well virtually (cutter 2020). our goal in this paper is to move past these anecdotal accounts and gather systematic evidence about whether, how, and why working from home will stick after the covid-19 pandemic. we survey 15,000 working-age americans over several waves between may and october 2020, asking about their working status during the pandemic, their views about working from home, as well as their employers plans with regards to working from home after the pandemic. other survey questions help us examine what persistently high levels of working from home mean for workers, for dense cities like new york and san francisco, and for productivity. our analysis first describes the state of working from home during the covid-19 pandemic. the left panel of figure 1 shows 42 percent of working age persons were working from home in may 2020 at the height of pandemic lockdowns, or 62 percent among those who were working for pay. these numbers are comparable to other estimates from early on in the pandemic. in october, our most recent survey wave, 32 percent of respondents, or 40 percent of persons working for pay, we're still working from home. while lower than in may, these numbers imply that the share of full paid working days spent working from home was still eight times larger than before the pandemic, based on data from the 2017-2018 american time use survey. after the pandemic, workers report their employers are planning for them to spend about 22 percent of all paid days (i.e., about one full day per week) working from home. this figure implies less working from home than during the pandemic, with almost three-quarters of this drop due to a reduction in the intensive margin, whereby workers continue working from home post-pandemic but for fewer days per week. this 22 percent figure is four times larger than in the pre-pandemic time use data, but still half as large as what workers want in a post-pandemic world. we then turn to the question of why working from home will stick. our survey evidence points to five key channels. our findings are complementary to other analyses, including research by jerbashian and vilalta-bufi's (2020) on how the prices of information and communication technologies impact working from home. first, reduced stigma. a large majority of respondents report perceptions about working from home have improved since the start of the pandemic among people they know. with fewer people viewing working from home as shirking from home, workers and their employers will be more willing to engage in it. second, the pandemic forced workers and firms to experiment with working from home en masse, giving them a chance to learn how well it actually works. the ubiquity of the pandemic facilitated this experimentation by allowing firms to evaluate working from home while their clients and suppliers also worked from home. our survey reveals that the experience has been positive and better than expected for the majority of firms and workers. thus, the pandemic has helped workers and organizations overcome inertia related to the costs of experimentation, as well as inertia stemming from biased expectations about working from home. in this regard, our evidence relates to the classic multi-armed bandit problem in that covid-19 compelled firms to experiment with a new production mode working from home and led them to acquire information that leads some of them to stick with the new mode after the forcing event ends. third, our survey reveals that the average worker has invested over 13 hours and about $660 dollars in equipment and infrastructure at home to facilitate working from home. we estimate these investments amount to 1.2 percent of gdp. in addition, firms have made sizable investments in back-end information technologies and equipment to support working from home. thus, after the pandemic, workers and firms will be positioned to work from home at lower marginal costs due to recent investments in tangible and intangible capital. fourth, about 70 percent of our survey respondents express a reluctance to return to some pre-pandemic activities even when a vaccine for covid-19 becomes widely available, for example riding subways and crowded elevators, or dining indoors at restaurants. this persistent fear of proximity to others is likely to leave some residual demand for social distancing at workplaces and prop up demand for working from home in the coming years. fifth, the rate of innovation around technologies that facilitate working from home appears to have accelerated, as documented by bloom, davis, and zhestkova (2020). consistent with ideas in the literature on directed technical change (e.g., acemoglu 2002), the massive expansion in working from home has boosted the market for working from equipment, software and technologies, spurring a burst of research that supports working from home, in particular, and remote interactivity, more broadly. we also argue that network effects are likely to amplify the impact of these five mechanisms. for example, coordination among several firms will facilitate doing business while their employees are working from home. when several firms are operating partially from home, it lowers the cost for other firms and workers to do the same, creating a positive feedback loop. after examining evidence for why working from home will stick after the covid-19 pandemic, we quantify some of the implications of the shift in working arrangements. workers value working from home as a perk, with the average survey respondent valuing the opportunity to work from home at about 8% of earnings. but the benefits will accrue disproportionally better-paid, more highly educated workers, because they value working from home more, and their employers are planning for them to work from home more often after the pandemic. our survey evidence also seems to confirm widely held views that the shift to working from home will diminish the economic fortunes of dense cities like new york and san francisco. we estimate that the post-pandemic shift to working from home (relative to the pre-pandemic situation) will lower post-covid worker expenditures on meals, entertainment, and shopping in central business districts by 5 to 10 percent of taxable sales. finally, many workers report being more productive while working from home during the pandemic than they were on business premises before the pandemic. taking these survey responses at face value, accounting for employer plans about who gets to work from home, and aggregating, we estimate that worker productivity will be 2.4 percent higher post-pandemic due to working from home. this number might be an underestimate, however, because our survey asks about productivity while working from home during covid. thus, it is subject to the negative effects of closed schools and pandemic-related stress, among other potentials drags on worker efficiency. alternatively, these estimates might be an overestimate if workers fail to internalize externalities associated with face-to-face collaboration that raise firm-level productivity and which are stifled when employees work from home. bartik et al. (2020) report that business owners and managers overwhelmingly perceive productivity to be lower during the pandemic. while the literature on working from home was relatively short before the pandemic, our paper builds on several studies. bloom et al. (2015) finds a 13% productivity impact of working from home in randomized control trials of chinese call center workers, and emanuel and harrington (2020) report an 8% uplift in a natural experiment involving call-center workers in a large us firm. (however, emmanuel and harrington also find evidence of negative worker selection into working from home.) choudhury et al. (2020) examine a natural experiment in the us patent office, finding additional 4% productivity benefits from shifting to work from anywhere (a geographically flexible version of work from home), consistent with the positive results of angelici and profeta (2020) on the advantages of smart working (flexible work location). interestingly, kunn, seel and zegners (2020) report worse performance among elite chess players competing from home during the covid pandemic, as assessed by chess artificial intelligence move assessment software. one explanation is that the home environment is less conducive to peak performance in cognitively demanding tasks. a second strand of the literature looks at the impact on employees of working from home. mas and pallais (2017) report substantial gains in welfare from working from home, finding an 8% wage equivalent valuation of working from home by employees in a randomized job offering with varying wages and working conditions. however, under the pandemic working from home 4 conditions have been far from ideal with children at home and shared working spaces, with mhring et al. (2020) arguing this has reduced family satisfaction, particularly for mothers. defilippis et al. (2020) examine meeting and email data from thousands of firms across 16 major cities and find employees working from home attend more (but shorter) meetings per day, send and receive more emails, and experience an increase in the workday of almost an hour, in what follows, we first provide details about our survey and methodology (section 2). then we describe the state of working from home during covid and quantify the extent of working from home after the end of the pandemic (section 3). section 4 examines the evidence for why working from home will stick after the pandemic, and, finally, section 5 describes the implications of a persistent shift towards working from home. 2) survey data and methodology starting in may 2020, we have run six waves of our own working from home survey using two commercial survey providers, who recruit respondents and field each survey over the internet on our behalf. each survey includes between 40 and 55 questions about respondent demographics, as well as various questions about working from home during and after the covid-19 pandemic. for example, we ask them about their current working status, their employers2019 plans for working from home after the pandemic, and whether perceptions about working from home have changed among people they know since the start of the pandemic. the survey questions for each wave, and figure a.1 shows two sample question. the first concerns respondents employers plans about working from after the pandemic, while the second asks about changes in perceptions of working from home associated with the pandemic. figure a.1 also shows how we use bold text and italics to highlight important parts of our questions. for example, the question about future employer plans highlights the period of time that we are referring to, after covid, in 2022 and later, and also highlights that we are specifically asking for employer plans rather than employee preferences.  our survey does not collect personally identifiable private information and we have no direct contact with respondents, or any way to follow up with them. all interactions and survey responses are collected directly by our survey providers' question pro and inquery. we pay a modest fee for each completed response. the six survey waves we have run far were in the field on the following dates. (we refer to each wave by the month shown in parentheses):  may 21 to 25, 2020 (may) ,june 30 to july 9 (july),august 21 to 28,2020 (august),  september 29 to october 2, 2020 (september), october 28 to november 3, 2020 (october). ,november 17 to november 20, 2020 (november) each wave collected 2,500 responses, except in august, when we collected 5,000 by running parallel surveys across our two survey providers. while it is possible for a given respondent to answer more than one of our survey waves, we are currently unable to track whether this takes place. thus, our combined dataset consists of six repeated cross sections. see prescott, bishara, and starr (2016, 2020) for a fuller discussion of how these online surveys work. we follow much of their approach and practices to obtain sensible responses. median time to completion is between 5 and 9 minutes depending on the survey wave. in particular, we've added questions in later surveys, so completion times are longest for the october wave (8 min, 44 sec) and shortest for may (3 min, 10 sec). we drop responses that take less than 2 minutes in may or less than 3 minutes in all of the other waves since these 201cspeeders201d are likely to be simply filling out as many surveys as possible without thinking about the questions carefully. the target population for our surveys includes working age (i.e. 20 to 64 years old) us residents who earned at least $20,000 in 2019. we thus focus on individuals that are strongly attached to the labor market. our survey providers recruit respondents from among a pool of verified individuals who have previously signed up to receive invitations to complete online surveys in exchange for some form of reward. no respondents sign up for our survey specifically. our preferred provider also directs survey invitations to roughly match the distribution of individuals in census data by age, income, gender, and race/ethnicity. in practice, our providers recruit from leading marketing research aggregators who pool potential respondents from several sources that respondents sign up with, obtaining a heterogeneous sample of individuals. part of the reason why aggregators obtain this heterogeneity is that respondents receive different forms of compensation depending on where they signed up to receive online surveys. some (presumably higher income) respondents may receive airline miles 6 in exchange for their response, for instance, while others receive cash or in-game credits enabling them to unlock valuable features of internet games. aggregators provide access to both kinds of respondents and many more. we are keenly aware that the quality of our estimates relies on obtaining a sample that is broadly representative of our target population. in pursuit of this goal we re-weight our raw survey responses to match the share of individuals in a given earnings-industry-state cell in a pooled sample of the 2010 to 2019 current population survey (cps) belonging to our target population (i.e. working age persons who earn more than $20,000 per year). figure 2 shows the marginal distribution of our raw survey responses, as well as the reweighted distribution and the distribution in the cps for six variables of interest. the top row shows the distributions along the three dimensions that are part of our reweighting scheme (earnings, industry of the current or most recent job, and geography). the bottom shows three additional variables of interest, namely education, age and sex. the top and bottom panels on the left show that our raw survey data materially over-samples high-earning, highly educated individuals, but the reweighted distribution is much closer to the cps along these dimensions. the raw data look broadly similar to the cps along the other dimensions and so do the reweighted distributions. there is still a concern that our respondents may be differentially selected on unobservables. based on conversations with our survey providers the most salient concern when collecting surveys like ours over the internet is that respondents might be differentially comfortable with technology. people who own smartphones and spend more time online may, intuitively, sign up to receive online surveys more often and respond differentially. given near-universal penetration of broadband internet, smartphones, and similar devices in 2020, this is perhaps less of a concern today than 10 to 15 years ago. however, we cannot fully rule out that our respondents might be different from the broader population after reweighting on observables. specifically, concerns would be that persons who are disproportionately likely to work from home might be more likely to sign up for online surveys and thus more likely to complete our particular survey. table a.1 displays reweighted summary statistics (i.e., to match the share of the population in the cps in a given earnings-industry-state cell) for many of our variables of interest. the median respondent is thus a 30 to 40-year old female, who earned between $40 and $50 thousand by working in 2019 and has completed a four-year college degree. although we obtained 15,000 raw responses across the five survey waves we have run so far, after dropping 201cspeeders201d and cleaning 7 up inconsistent responses we end up with a core sample of 13,746 survey responses. some variables are based on questions that we did not ask in every wave. for example, we did not ask about employer plans about post-covid working from home arrangements until the july wave, so we end up with less than 13,746 observations for that variable. in other cases, we only asked a question from respondents who claimed to be working from home, or who worked from home at some point during covid. thus, we have fewer observations, around 6,500, for the number of hours spent learning how to work from home effectively, and similarly for the amount of money invested in equipment and infrastructure enabling work from home. we supplement our own data collection efforts with published data from the bureau of labor statistics american time use survey (atus) job flexibilities and work schedules module. this survey was run continuously in 2017 and 2018 on about 10,000 respondents who were all wage and salary workers. we use atus data primarily to quantify how many full paid days were spent working from home prior to the covid-19 pandemic, for comparison with the amount of working from home reported in our own survey during and planned for after the end of the pandemic.the state of working from home during covid we begin our analysis by examining the state of working from home during covid, in comparison with before the pandemic. we estimate the extent of working from home during the covid-19 pandemic using the following question, which we fielded in each of our five survey waves: currently (this week) what is your working status? - working on my business premises - working from home - still employed and paid, but not working - unemployed - not working and not looking for work to see the full survey here then, we classify the responses into three categories, namely working on business premises, working from home, and not working, the last of which aggregates responses across the final three response options. our survey responses reveal the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic forced a mass experiment in working from home. the left panel of figure 1 compares the distribution of responses across those three categories for the first and last of the five survey waves we've fielded so far. in may, when lockdowns or stay-at-home orders covered almost 90 percent of all us counties (see coibon et al. 2020), over 40 percent of respondents were working from home, more than were working on business premises or not working. in fact, work on business premises was the least frequent response, with just about 25 percent of respondents in that month. by late october, however, those working on business premises had become the largest group with nearly 45 percent of responses. the prevalence of working from home declines by about 10 percentage points but remains high in october at about 32 percent of respondents. our data also show the partial recovery in labor market conditions, with the share of responses classified under not working dropping from 33 to 23 percent. the right panel of figure 1 shows how the share of paid working days provided from home varies over time. we first estimate the amount of pre-pandemic working from home using publicly available tabulations from the 2017-2018 american time use survey (atus).among all workers, just 14.7 percent spent any full days working from home before the pandemic. among those who had any full paid days working from home, the frequency was the following:  less than once a month: 18.4 once a month: 13.5 once every two weeks: 13.1  at least 1 day per week: 10.2 1 to 2 days per week: 17.4  3 to 4 days per week: 12.8  5 or more days per week: 14.5 3 the relevant tabulations and documentation are available at 9 thus, we estimate the share of full paid working from home days before the pandemic is 5.3 percent.we plot this number as the starting point of the time series shows in the right panel of figure 1. then, we estimate the share of paid days spent working from home during each of our survey waves, namely the share of respondents to our current working status question who choose working from home among those who were either working from home or working on business premises. the right panel of figure 1 plots our estimate for each wave along with its 95 percent confidence interval on the vertical axis, while showing the timing of each wave on the horizontal axis. looking at figure 1 we can see how the extent of working from home during the covid- 19 pandemic dwarfs pre-pandemic work from home. on average across our five survey waves, 47.5 percent of all paid working days were provided from home, about 9 times as high as in the pre-pandemic time use data. as we might expect, working from home is most prevalent in may at over 62.1 percent of all paid working days (or just shy of 12 times the pre-pandemic figure) and declines gradually to 42.1 percent (or 8 times the pre-pandemic figure) in late october when our most recent wave was in the field. table 1 examines how the prevalence of working from home during the pandemic varies across demographics. pooling across survey waves, 35.3 (0.4) percent of all respondents (including those not working) claim to be working from home on the week of the survey. conscious of the pandemic's ever-changing state, since august we also ask our respondents during the covid-19 pandemic have you at any point worked primarily from home, for example, due to lockdowns or because it was unsafe or otherwise not possible to work on business premises? table 1 reports on the top right that nearly 60 percent of respondents have indeed worked from home during the pandemic, even if they are not at the moment. table 1 also shows the prevalence of working from home is higher for men than women, revealing a 5.5 percentage point gender gap in the amount of working from home during covid-19.  however, differentials are much larger when we compare respondents across by their earnings or education, consistent with the analyses by bick, blandin, and mertens (2020) and brynjolfsson et al., (2020), who focus on the early months of the pandemic, namely april and may. the share of respondents working from home is over four times as high among those with graduate degrees than among those who did not finish high school, and nearly twice as high among workers earning $150,000 per year than those earning between $20,000 and $50,000. we find the comparisons across demographic groups from table 1 interesting, but they do not show how working from home varies with a given trait, conditional on others. it may be, for example, that women work from home during the pandemic less than men because they tend to work at firms that provide in-person services as argued in alon et al. (2020). to get a handle on what factors predict working from home during covid we therefore regress an indicator for whether a given respondent is working from home on individual characteristics collected from the survey and report the results in columns 1 to 7 of table 2. we include date (i.e., survey wave) fixed effects in all regressions since we know from figure 1 that the average amount of working from home varies substantially as the pandemic evolves. to make the coefficients easier to interpret, we use standardized (mean zero, unit standard deviation) versions of our continuous independent variables, namely years of education, log(earnings), internet quality, and the share of votes obtained by joe biden in the 2020 us presidential election in each respondent's state of residence. our survey collects data on earnings, education, and internet quality using discrete categories (see appendix a for the relevant questions), so we assign numerical values for each response. for example, we assign 10 years of education to respondents who did not finish high school, 12 to those with high school degrees, and 16 to those with four-year bachelors degrees. columns 1 to 7 of table 2 show that education, earnings, and state-level politics are the strongest marginal predictors of whether a respondent is working from home during the covid-19 pandemic. respondents with one-standard-deviation higher education or earnings predict a 5 we classify states as 201cred201d or 201cblue201d based on the cook political report's partisan voting index, calculated using data from the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections and published at . we classified the three states designated as 201ceven201d in the index, namely new hampshire, pennsylvania, and wisconsin, as blue based on joe biden winning these states in 2020. marginal 5.5 and 7.2 percentage point higher likelihood that the respondent is working from home during the pandemic. so do the politics of the respondent's home state: a one-standard-deviation higher vote share for joe biden in the 2020 election is associated with a 2.2 percentage point higher likelihood of working from home. by contrast, other variables like gender or sex, whether there are children under 18 living in the household, or internet quality have smaller and statistically insignificant coefficients. much of the narrative surrounding the economic impact of the pandemic has focused on comparisons across industries, with in-person services being particularly hit. interestingly, however, adding industry fixed effects between columns 6 and 7 has a limited impact on the r-squared and only modestly lowers the coefficients on education, earnings, and politics. collecting the results from figure 1 and tables 1 to 2 we conclude that the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a mass experiment in working from home. our data point to an eight-fold or more increase in the share of paid working days provided from home relative to pre-pandemic levels. the question, then, is how much of this shift towards working from home will stick after the end of the pandemic, and for what sorts of workers? 4) the future of working from home our survey includes two questions that we use to forecast the amount of working from home after the end of the covid-19 pandemic. the first asks respondents for their preferences regarding working from home after the end of the pandemic: after covid, in 2022 and later, how often would you like to have paid workdays at home?  the second question instead refers to their employer's plans for their working arrangements after the pandemic: after covid, in 2022 and later, how often is your employer planning for you to work full days at home?

DHL - Digital Twins in Logistics (Jun-19).pdf,"Digital twins, a digital replica of an actual or potential physical asset, are widely used in engineering, manufacturing, energy, and the automotive industry to inform critical asset management. However, the TL sector has seen little adoption of digital twins. Early examples are now emerging as digital twins of supply chain facilities and logistics hubs are being developed. DHL believes that digital twins will accelerate innovation in Logistics, with a model of an entire supply network as the ultimate digital twin. Modern GIS systems able to incorporate dynamic sensor data from across the supply chain are key enablers for digital twins in logistics, making this an interesting future use case to consider for HEREs TL business.","A dhl perspective on the impact of digital twins on the logistics industry powered by dhl trend. for centuries, people have used pictures and models to help them tackle complex problems. great buildings first took shape on the architect's drawing board. classic cars were shaped in wood and clay. overtime, our modeling capabilities have become more sophisticated. computers have replaced pencils. 3d computer models have replaced 2d drawings. advanced modeling systems can simulate the operation and behavior of a product as well as its geometry.until recently, however, there remained an unbridged divide between model and reality. no two manufactured objects are ever truly identical, even if they have been built from the same set of drawings. computer models of machines don't evolve as parts wear out and are replaced, as fatigue accumulates in structures, or as owners make modifications to suit their changing needs. that gap is now starting to close. fueled by developments in the internet of things (iot), big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and digital reality technologies, the recent arrival of digital twins heralds a tipping point where the physical and digital worlds can be managed as one, and we can interact with the digital counterpart of physical things much like we would the things themselves, even in 3d space around us. led by the engineering, manufacturing, automotive, and energy industries in particular, digital twins are already creating new value. they are helping companies to design, visualize, monitor, manage, and maintain their assets more effectively. and they are unlocking new business opportunities like the provision of advanced services and the generation of valuable insight from operational data. as logistics professionals, we have been thinking about how digital twins will change traditional supply chains, and how the logistics sector might embrace digital twins to improve its own processes. our objective in writing this report is to share our findings and to help you answer the following key questions:what is a digital twin and what does it mean for my organization?what best-practice examples from other industries can be applied to logistics? how will my supply chain change because of digital twins? looking ahead, we believe that the adoption of digital twins across industries will drive better decision-making in the physical world. that, in turn, will drive significant changes in the operation of supply chains and logistics processes.in the logistics industry itself, digital twins will extend the benefits of iot already being applied today. they will bring deeper insight into the planning, design, operation, and optimization of supply chains, from individual assets and shipments to entire global supply networks.page we think there has never been a more exciting time for industries and logisticians to work together to leverage the full potential of digital twins. on behalf of us all at dhl, we look forward to collaborating with you in this exciting and potentially transformative field. the digital twin comes of age for many years, scientists and engineers have created mathematical models of real-world objects and over time these models have become increasingly sophisticated. today the evolution of sensors and network technologies enables us to link previously offline physical assets to digital models. in this way, changes experienced by the physical object are reflected in the digital model, and insights derived from the model allow decisions to be made about the physical object, which can also be controlled with unprecedented precision. understanding digital twins while the digital twin concept has existed since the start of the 21st century, the approach is now reaching a tipping point where widespread adoption is likely in the near future. that's because a number of key enabling technologies have reached the level of maturity necessary to support the use of digital twins for enterprise applications. those technologies include low-cost data storage and computing power, the availability of robust, high-speed wired and wireless networks, and cheap, reliable sensors. the use of a high-fidelity simulation or a direct physical replica to support the operation and maintenance of an asset has a long history. nasa pioneered a pairing approach during the early years of space exploration. when the apollo 13 spacecraft suffered significant damage on a mission to the moon in 1970, nasa engineers were able to test and refine potential recovery strategies in a paired module on earth before issuing instructions to the stricken crew. to this day, pairing - now using digital models - remains a central part of the us space agency's strategy for managing space missions.at first the complexity and cost involved in building digital twins limited their use to the aerospace and defense sectors (see the timeline in figure 1) as the physical objects were high-value, mission-critical assets operating in challenging environments that could benefit from simulation. relatively few other applications shared the same combination of high-value assets and inaccessible operating conditions to justify the investment.that situation is changing rapidly. today, as part of their normal business processes, companies are using their own products to generate much of the data required to build a digital twin; computer-aided design (cad) and simulation tools are commonly used in product development, for example. many products, including consumer electronics, automobiles, and even household appliances now include sensors and data communication capabilities as standard features. computer-driven simulation emerges in specific and highly specialized fields for expert use only.simulation applications simulation tools drop in price, broadening availability and applicability to many engineering and design fields. simulation-driven system design advanced simulation becomes central to complex, multi-disciplinary system design and engineering. an enhanced range of simulation applications enables model-based systems engineering.digital twins, a virtual model (once only used in simulation) is seamlessly and continually updated across the entire lifecycle of a product, where the virtual model supports the operation of the physical product through direct linkage and representation of its operational data. ge has created a digital twin of the boeing 777 engine specifically for engine blade maintenance. attributes of a digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical asset , represents a unique physical asset associated with a single, specific instance of a physical asset continuously collects data (through sensors) continuously connected to the physical asset, updating itself with any change to the asset's state, condition, or context provides value through visualization, analysis, prediction, or optimization .as corporate interest in digital twins grows, so too does the number of technology providers to supply this demand. industry researchers expect the digital twins market to grow at an annual rate of more than 38 percent over the next few years, passing the usd $26 billion point by 2025.plenty of technology players have an eye on this potentially lucrative space. the broad range of underlying technologies required by digital twins encourages many companies to enter the market, including large enterprise technology companies such as sap, microsoft, and ibm. these organizations are well-positioned to apply their cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and enterprise security capabilities to the creation of digital twin solutions. besides, makers of automation systems and industrial equipment such as ge, siemens, and honeywell are ushering in a new era of industrial machinery and services built on digital twins. also companies offering product lifecycle management (plm) such as ptc and dassault syst00e8mes are embracing digital twins as a fundamental core technology to manage product development from initial concept to end of life. digital twin opportunities are also attracting the attention of start-ups, with players such as cityzenith, navvis, and swim.ai developing their own offerings tailored to particular niches and use cases. what makes a digital twin? in practice with so many different applications and stakeholders involved, there is no perfect consensus on what constitutes a digital twin. as our examples show very clearly later in this report, digital twins come in many forms with many different attributes. it can be tempting for companies to ride the wave of interest in the approach by attaching a digital twin label to a range of pre-existing 3d modeling, simulation, and asset-tracking technologies. but this short sells the complexity of a true digital twin. most commentators agree on key characteristics shared by the majority of digital twins. the attributes that help to differentiate true digital twins from other types of computer models or simulations are: a digital twin is a virtual model of a real thing. a digital twin simulates both the physical state and behavior of the thing. a digital twin is unique, associated with a single, specific instance of the thing. a digital twin is connected to the thing, updating itself in response to known changes to the thing's state, condition, or context.a digital twin provides value through visualization, analysis, prediction, or optimization.the range of potential digital twin applications means that even these defining attributes can blur in some situations. a digital twin may exist before its physical counterpart is made, for example, and persist long after the thing has reached the end of its life. a single thing can have more than one twin, with different models built for different users and use cases, such as what-if scenario planning or predicting the behavior of the thing under future operating conditions. for example, the owners of factories, hospitals, and offices may create multiple models of an existing facility as they evaluate the impact of changes in layout or operating processes.today, researchers and technology companies have built digital twins at every scale from atoms to planets. the smallest digital twin can represent the behavior of specific materials, chemical reactions, or drug interactions. at the other extreme, a large digital twin can model entire metropolitan cities. the majority of digital twins sit somewhere in the middle, with most current applications aimed at more human-scale problems, especially the modeling of products and their manufacturing processes. one notable trend is the development of larger, more complex digital twins as organizations evolve from modeling single products or machines to modeling complete production lines, factories, and facilities. similarly, efforts are underway to create digital twins of entire cities or even of national-scale energy infrastructure and transport networks. the uk is even working on plans to develop a digital twin of the whole country to serve as a repository for multiple sources of data related to buildings, infrastructure, and utilities. underlying technologies enabling digital twins ,five technology trends are developing in a complementary way to enable digital twins, namely the internet of things, cloud computing, apis and open standards, artificial intelligence, and digital reality technologies.the internet of things (iot). the rapid growth of iot is one important factor driving the adoption of digital twins. iot technologies make digital twins possible because it is now technically and economically feasible to collect large volumes of data from a wider range of objects than before. companies often underestimate the complexity and volume of data generated by iot products and platforms, requiring tools to help them manage and make sense of all the data they are now collecting. a digital twin is often an ideal way to structure, access, and analyze complex product-related data. digital twins rely on a host of underlying technologies that are only now reaching the point where they can be applied reliably, cost-effectively, and at scale.underlying technologies of digital twins apis and open standards provide the necessary tools to extract, share, and harmonize data from multiple systems that contribute to a single digital twin.artificial intelligence leverages historical and real-time data paired with machine learning frameworks to make predictions about future scenarios or events that will occur within the context of the asset. augmented, mixed &virtual reality renders the spatial model and visualization of the digital twin, providing the medium for collaboration and interaction with it.cloud computing allows storage and processing of large volumes of machine data from the asset and its digital twin in real-time.internet of things high-precision sensors enable the continuous collection of machine data, state, and condition from the physical asset to its digital twin in real-time via wireless networks. developing, maintaining, and using digital twins is a compute- and storage-intensive endeavor. thanks to the continually falling cost of processing power and storage, large data center networks with access provided via software-as-a-service (saas) solutions now enable companies to acquire exactly the computing resources they need, when they need them, while keeping costs under control.apis & open standards. closed, proprietary-by-design simulation tools and factory automation platforms are increasingly becoming a thing of the past. technology companies created and protected their own data models, requiring intensive, ground-up software development to build infrastructure from scratch for each new product. now the availability of open standards and public application programming interfaces (apis) has dramatically streamlined sharing and data exchange, making it possible for users to combine data from multiple systems and tools quickly and reliably. artificial intelligence (ai). dramatic improvements in the power and usability of advanced analytical tools have transformed the way companies extract useful insights from big, complex data sets. machine-learning frameworks are enabling the development of systems that can make decisions autonomously as well as predictions about future conditions based on historical and real-time data. augmented, mixed, and virtual reality. to leverage, consume, and effectively take action on the insights generated by a digital twin, it must be rendered either on a screen (2d) or in physical space (3d). to date, most digital twins have been rendered in two-dimensional space, as the conventional computing norms of today limit us to displays on monitors, laptops, and other screens. but increasingly, augmented reality is enabling us to display digital content in 3d. in addition, mixed reality allows us to interact with digital content in our existing physical environment. and virtual reality allows us to create entirely new environments to render digital twins in a highly immersive way, creating the richest consumption of and interaction with the information.while the above technologies iot, cloud computing, apis, and artificial intelligence provide the underlying sensing and processing infrastructure required to create a digital twin, augmented, mixed, and virtual reality are the tools for visualizing digital twins and making them real to the user.1.4 how digital twins create value digital twins can be used in different ways to add value to a product, process, user, or organization. the value available, and the investment required to capture it, are highly application dependent. most fall into one or more of the following broad categories. descriptive value. the ability to immediately visualize the status of an asset via its digital twin is valuable when those assets are remote or dangerous examples include spacecraft, offshore wind turbines, power stations, and manufacturer-owned machines operating in customer plants. digital twins make information more accessible and easier to interpret from a distance. analytical value. digital twins that incorporate simulation technologies can provide data that is impossible to measure directly on the physical object for example information generated inside an object. this can be used as a troubleshooting tool for existing products and can help to optimize the performance of subsequent product generations. diagnostic value. digital twins can include diagnostic systems that use measured or derived data to suggest the most probable root causes of specific states or behaviors. these systems can be implemented in the form of explicit rules based on company know-how, or they may leverage analytics and machine learning approaches to derive relationships based on historical data.predictive value. the likely future state of the physical model can be predicted using a digital twin model. one example is ge's use of digital twins in wind farms to predict power output. the most sophisticated digital twins do more than merely predict the issue that may occur; they also propose figure 5the corresponding solution. digital twins will play a significant role in the development of future smart factories capable of making autonomous decisions about what to make, when and how, to maximize customer satisfaction and profitability.early adopters of digital twins commonly report benefits in three areas: data-driven decision making and collaboration streamlined business processes, new business models, because each digital twin presents a single visualization to key decision-makers, it provides a single source of truth for an asset that drives stakeholder collaboration to resolve problems expediently. digital twins can be used to automate tedious error-prone activities such as inspections, testing, analysis, and reporting. this frees teams to focus on higher-value activities. digital twins are a major driver of product-as-a-service business models or servitization this is when companies abandon the one-time sale of a product to instead sell outcomes by managing the full operation of the asset throughout its lifecycle. digital twins allow manufacturers to monitor, diagnose, and optimize their assets remotely, helping to improve availability and reduce service costs.the digital twin through the product lifecycle since their inception, digital twins have been closely associated with product lifecycle management (plm). digital twins are now used throughout the full product lifecycle, with a product's twin emerging during the development process and evolving to support different business needs as a product progresses through design, manufacturing, launch, distribution, operation, servicing, and decommissioning. product development. data from the digital twins of previous products can be used to refine the requirements and specifications of future ones. virtual prototyping using 3d modeling and simulation allows faster design iterations and reduces the need for physical tests as depicted in figure 6. during the design phase, tests with digital twins can detect clashes between components, assess ergonomics, and simulate product behavior in a wide variety of environments. together these measures help to reduce development costs, accelerate time to market, and improve the reliability of the final product production.digital twins facilitate collaboration between cross-functional teams in the manufacturing process. they can be used to clarify specifications with suppliers and allow designs to be optimized for manufacturing and shipping. if the organization manufactures a new digital twin with every product it makes, each model will incorporate data on the specific components and materials used in the product, configuration options selected by end customers, and process conditions experienced during production. digital twins of production lines allow layouts, processes, and material flows to be tested and optimized before a new manufacturing facility is commissioned. driving improved business outcomes with digital twins by sam george, director, azure internet of things, Microsoft for years now, microsoft's partners and customers have been using the cloud and digital twins to create breakthrough applications for a wide variety of industries.we've learned that most digital transformation efforts benefit from context about the physical world by creating a digital twin. for example, customers have been creating digital replicas of buildings, connecting building systems like heating and cooling, as well as electrical systems to space utilization and people within the building. energy sector customers are modeling their distribution grid to even out usage spikes and ensure substations aren't over utilized, enabling them to avoid unnecessary, costly infrastructure updates. digital twins support the entire lifecycle, from design time, through construction and commissioning, all the way through to operations. with these digital twins, customers can then predict the future state of their models, as well as simulate potential changes. a digital twin helps bring value to the various iot data into the model which fits their domain, and without it the iot data has less value.it is critical to connecting to the devices and sensors in the physical world to provide real-time and operationalized data not just the idealized state of the system. this enables customers to take advantage of replicas alive with data. by adding artificial intelligence (ai) to the mix, customers can identify trends, forecast the future, optimize and simulate changes. this enables customers to save money and improve planning, products, and customer relationships. digital twins enable faster design iterations and rapid prototyping before going into production. challenges in applying digital twins ; there are significant challenges to the widespread adoption of digital twins. matching complex assets and their behavior digitally with precision and in real-time can quickly exceed financial and computing resources, data governance capabilities, and even organizational culture. this section identifies the stumbling blocks that may be encountered when leveraging digital twins. digital twins require considerable investment in technology platforms, model development, and high-touch maintenance. while most of these costs continue to fall, the decision to implement a digital twin must always be compared to alternative approaches that might deliver similar value at a lower cost. if a company is interested in a small number of critical parameters, these insights may be gathered more cost-effectively via an iot system based on sensors and a conventional database.precise representation' for the foreseeable future, no digital twin will be a perfect representation of its physical counterpart. matching the physical, chemical, electrical, and thermal state of a complex asset is an extremely challenging and costly endeavor. this tends to force engineers to make assumptions and simplifications in their models that balance the desired attributes of the twin with technical and economic constraints. data quality. good models depend on good data. which may be a difficult thing to guarantee in digital twin applications which depend on data supplied by hundreds or thousands of remote sensors, operating in demanding field conditions and communicating over unreliable networks. as a minimum, companies will need to develop methods to identify and isolate bad data, and to manage gaps and inconsistencies in product data streams.operate & service ; once the product passes into the hands of the end-user, its digital twin continues to accumulate data on its performance and operating conditions. this data helps to support maintenance planning, troubleshooting, and optimizing product performance. as products are updated and adapted or parts replaced, the digital twin is amended accordingly. aggregate information from multiple digital twins can be analyzed to identify usage trends and optimize future designs. end-of-life: when a product is no longer required by the user, digital twin data guides appropriate end-of-life actions. data on the operating conditions of specific components inform decisions on whether to re-use, recondition, recycle, or scrap these items. material data can help to determine appropriate recycling and waste streams. and the data accumulated by the digital twin during this process can be retained for future analysis. digital twins are likely to create a technology transition in any organization that implements them. it is of paramount importance that we look at the opportunities technology shifts like digital twins bring, rather than the pitfalls. we've got to be open to new things and leverage the opportunities afforded by technology in such a way that they help us increase the quality of life and benefit society and companies.critical to leveraging the insights created today, the biggest challenge of the by new technology like digital twins. technological transition is the rapid pace finally, we all have to acquire new skills of change. much of what we experience on a constant basis. this form of now was considered science fiction 20 continuing learning is a top priority at years ago, digital twins included. we must siemens. and it's not just about upskilling do some things differently than we have but also about reskilling because unless done in the past, and this can't happen we retire within the next twelve months without a culture change. we need to be open to learning totally new it's a journey that consists of many little things.steps we need to break down silos by in this context, the role of managers maintaining a global network and changes. being a boss is not enough, exchanging ideas, within our own they have to play multiple roles. they may company and beyond it. we need to be colleagues, mentors, or coaches or flatten hierarchies and enable flexible mentees who learn from others. they working. managers have to guide and may have to switch back and forth support their teams, encourage them to between these roles several times a day try new things and allow errors. depending on the situation and on the, therefore, managers can't just specific colleagues they're dealing with. communicate with a small group, they in the digital age, soft skills are becoming need to collaborate openly across all more important than ever! parts of organizations. collaboration is protection. a digital twin is a reservoir of intellectual property and know-how. the models and data incorporated into a twin include details of a product's design and performance. it may also contain sensitive data on customer processes and usage. that creates challenges around data ownership, identity protection, data control, and governance of data access by different user groups.cybersecurity: digital twins will be tempting targets for cybercriminals, the data links that connect physical objects to their twins provide a new point of entry for malevolent actors seeking to disrupt an organization's operations. where digital twins play a role in the control of their physical counterparts, compromising a twin may have a direct and potentially devastating real-world impact. those characteristics make effective management of digital twin cybersecurity a critical priority, and one that will present new challenges to many organizations. interoperability. despite significant progress in openness and standardization, technical and commercial barriers to the exchange of data remain. and where a digital twin relies on simulation or ai technologies supplied by a specific vendor, it may be difficult or impossible to replicate that functionality using alternative providers, effectively locking companies into long-term single-supplier relationships.education: the use of digital twins will require staff, customers, and suppliers to adopt new ways of working. that presents challenges in terms of change management and capability building. companies must ensure users have the skills and tools they need to interact with digital twins and must be sufficiently motivated to make the necessary transition. leveraging the new technologies required for digital twins typically requires a profound cultural shift to fully realize the value afforded by this change. every technology wave is accompanied by its own unique set of challenges and digital twins are no exception to this pattern. industries with core offerings that depend on complex products and machinery were first to leverage the benefits of digital twins. starting from humble beginnings in the aerospace and defense industries, digital twins are now enhancing operational value chains in the engineering, manufacturing, energy, and automotive industries. while today digital twins might seem like a far cry for the logistics industry, the next chapter examines current best practices in several different industries that logistics professionals can potentially learn from. digital twins can ultimately represent any physical thing, from nanomaterials all the way to entire cities. even human beings and their behaviors have been modeled by digital twins in some cases. organizations in multiple sectors are developing, testing, and utilizing digital twins within their operations.

DHL - Post-COVID Supply Chain Recovery (Jul-20).pdf,"In this white paper, DHL outlines their view of the new normal from a supply chain perspective and how businesses can recover from the crisis by using sophisticated supply chains as a gateway to future optimization. Companies need to go through a precursor phase on their path to fully transitioning to the new normal, with supply chain visibility and control playing a key role in this transition. To that end, the paper proposes that the massive interruptions to automotive supply chains caused by the Japanese earthquake in 2011 provide valuable lessons on how to tackle location-based shortcomings in supply chain resilience","the journey towards the new normala dhl perspective on the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on supply chains and logistics post-coronavirus supply chain recovery .many say that this pandemic will change the world forever. for a post-pandemic world, this crisis will accelerate changes that had already begun, and at the same time unveil new trends and new priorities. as a result, consumers, businesses, and supply chain managers will find themselves in a new normal.in this paper we outline the shape of the new normal from a supply chain perspective, to help you answer the following questions:what are the characteristics of a new normal relevant for supply chains? how does a transition to a new normal via a pre-new normal phase look like?  what are the post-coronavirus impacts on supply chains and how can supply chain management contribute to future business success?what are the long-term lasting lessons to consider as a supply chain decision-maker? what are the actions to be taken and success factors in order to build the resilient supply chain of the future?we believe that there is no single solution to the opportunities and challenges ahead caused by the coronavirus pandemic. we, therefore, invite you, our customers and partners, to discuss those challenges, and to explore innovative supply chain solutions in the near future.ypost-coronavirus, supply chains will not be the same as they were pre-coronavirus.supply chain innovation will be essential and collaboration along the value chain will be the enabler for future business success. businesses won't immediately transition into new ways of operating, and an interim stage the pre-new normal phase will bridge the gap. post-coronavirus supply chain recovery transportation and warehouse networks might have to be reconfigured to ensure more flexible, but still cost-effective, supply chains. workplaces will see changed practices around social distancing.in the pre-new normal phase, resilience, demand, transportation, warehousing-related topics, and workplace operational practices will become critical issues.the journey from lockdown to pre-new normal and then to new realities will require a re-assessment of today's supply chains based on a changing environment and a potential new set of priorities. supply chains will reshape themselves around resilience, with more diversified manufacturing, and multiple sources of supply.supply chain disruptions, dhl resilience 360, published a resilience report, the spread of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is first and foremost a public health emergency .the novel coronavirus: impact on supply chain operations amid the lunar new year on of international concern as declared by the world 29 january 2020. even at this very early stage, the health organization. the report highlighted severe disruptions to air cargo, as well as congestion for vessels on the yangtze river near wuhan, highlighting the likelihood of impending supply chain disruptions. starting early march with northern italy followed by most of europe and north america, more and more countries went into lockdown with most non-essential commercial activity halted and people confined to their homes. as an example, beginning of april 2020 in europe, more than 1 million of the 2.6 million auto workers had been furloughed at large car manufacturers and suppliers.however, even in its very early stages, its significant impact on supply chains and the crucial role of supply chain management became obvious. it has become more clear that the essential role of the logistics industry is to keep supply chains operating around the globe. hence there is a remarkable story to be told about the sector that supports our well-being in every possible dimension; one that continues to unfold. with border closures to international visitors and other travel restrictions, airlines either completely or mostly suspended their entire operations, leading to a significant contraction of cargo capacity. freighters and charter capacity was used to deliver essential medical equipment; other shipments were switched to alternative modes such as ocean or rail transport.in summary, the resilience of supply chains was tested in unexpected ways. however, the following economic crisis was not driven by collapsing supply chains but a significant lack of consumer demand. hence, any shape of recovery depends on the speed and magnitude of consumer spending behavior. short and long-term it seems inevitable that supply chains will be different. in the wake of the still ongoing pandemic, many lessons have been learned already; a desire for more resilient and flexible supply chains has become more prominent. as countries begin to emerge from lockdown, businesses are contemplating those lessons, and beginning to consider exactly how supply chains will differ between yesterday and tomorrow. even allowing for an element of hype, over-reaction or exaggeration, it seems almost certain that a return to normality will herald a new normal that is very different from the old normal.transition to the pre-new normal at its start, countries and their businesses and their supply chains businesses will be emerging from won't transition to the new normal lockdown, and beginning to engage immediately. its shape, for one thing, once more in economic activity with isn't yet clear. we see its outlines, but production and sales increasing. not all the fine detail. at its end, the new normal will have arrived. in between there will be a period of indeterminate duration, longer in some countries and industries than in others, of adjustment. however, it is simply not practical to go from today's crisis situation to immediate, full operation. so it makes sense to think about and plan for an intermediate phase: one that we can actually envisage more precisely, and begin to understand. we call this intermediate phase the pre-new normal. lasting lesson the covid-19 coronavirus has been a huge wake-up call. businesses that had considered their supply chains to be resilient suddenly found out that they weren't. businesses and industries that had resisted change suddenly found themselves embracing it.consumers used to abundance found themselves dealing with scarcity. will things go back to as they were before? no: too many lessons have been learned.omera khan  professor of supply chain management at royal holloway, university of london it makes sense to think about and plan for an intermediate phase key supply chain drivers accordingly, it perhaps makes most how best to explore these scenarios? sense to view these scenarios through clearly, the transition environments the lens of how they are shaped by the will affect different industries in post-coronavirus impact of key supply different ways, and probably at chain driver categories: slightly different times: aerospace and automotive may be slower to recover than, for example, life sciences, healthcare, and the foodstuffs supply chain. resilience,demand, transportation & warehousing,workplace operational practice in each scenario, we explore what the new normal might look like, describe the likely shape of the pre-new normal, and briefly weave in what might be termed the lasting habits that will emerge as businesses adjust to a post-coronavirus world. we also briefly address, where pertinent, any noteworthy sector or industry ramifications not otherwise addressed. re-starting operations is already a challenge under normal circumstances. in a volatile post-lockdown situation companies have to adjust ramp-up speed even on a daily basis. watching operations and supplier readiness as well as anticipating customer demand are crucial. resilience is often thought of as an operational issue, focused on securing the supply from first-tier suppliers. in general, few organizations extend resiliency planning further upstream to their second- or third-tier suppliers. transportation routes: sometimes overlooked, there is also a strategic dimension to resilience. the risk profile of a supply chain is generally locked in within the early stages of strategic development. ensuring that the processes to achieve supply chain transparency and continuous monitoring are embedded at an early stage of supply chain design is recognized as good practice, in future, supply chain managers, planners and procurement professionals may well consider further tiers as they make decisions about sourcing, inventory buffers, and lasting lesson the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated to governments yet again how supply chains are vulnerable to far-away events in far-away places. going forward, businesses can expect both regulatory and social pressure to ensure that they are more resilient to such shocks, with stocks maintained of critical products.. the coronavirus pandemic has exposed resiliency weak spots, both for countries and businesses. for example, it transpired that the active ingredients for a number of important pharmaceutical products were manufactured in china, in factories then under lockdown. as united states trade representative robert lighthizer told g20 trade ministers at the end of march: we are learning in this crisis that the overdependence on other countries as a source of cheap medical products and supplies has created a strategic vulnerability to our economy. those that relied on global supply chains for their products were left vulnerable. pharmaceutical supply chains to be repatriated back to the united states, in order to simultaneously reduce america's foreign dependencies, strengthen its public health industrial base, and defend our citizens, economy, and national security.the european commission has equally become acutely aware of europe's reliance on asia for the production of personal protective equipment, and is working with european manufacturers to establish greater manufacturing capacity in europe, in part on an emergency basis by re-purposing existing production lines. implicit in the operational view is that resilience is cost-neutral: there might be a cost, to be sure, but it is often well worth paying for the resulting added protection and peace of mind. as those costs increase, the decision as to whether the price is worth paying is made at an increasing level of seniority. clearly, this points to a rise in the prominence of senior supply chain executives within the corporate hierarchy and decision-making process.lasting lesson we are moving from an era marked by an emphasis on procurement for cost, to an era marked by an emphasis on procurement for resilience. richard wilding professor of supply chain strategy, cranfield school of management has sharply exposed the international nature of many supply chains configuration .resilience diversification of supply chains for more resilience was already considered by many businesses prior to the coronavirus pandemic. exposure to the supply chain disruption stemming from natural disasters was one impetus. for instance, consider the flooding in thailand in october 2011, which submerged seven of the country's largest industrial zones for several weeks, including two zones with factories belonging to two of the world's largest manufacturers of computer hard drives. according to a new york times report, of the 227 factories in thailand's khlong luang industrial zone, only 15% had restarted production six months later. trade tensions, too, have contributed to the move towards more diversified supply chains. political rhetoric is one thing, but actual tariffs and import quotas quite another and businesses are responding accordingly.for all these reasons, then, an era is dawning in which the configurations of supply chain networks are being reviewed. businesses are beginning to re-assess manufacturing, transportation and warehouse networks, or alternatively invest in far higher inventory buffers, or other courses of action they judge will provide them with long-term stable security of supply.in this new normal, cost efficiencies may now be seen as of secondary importance. supply chain 4.0 was already driving businesses towards this direction, investing in smaller and more widely dispersed warehouses in closer proximity to customers, rather than large centrally located facilities. the impact of the lockdown has highlighted the added benefits and flexibility of these more distributed networks, and although their inventory holding costs may be higher, the result is greater speed to market and improved resilience.flooding in thailand in october 2011 submerged seven of the country's largest industrial zones for several weeks.resilience, little on the ground progress can be accomplished in such a short timescale. but nevertheless, there will be progress. executive boards will consider position papers and make decisions; feasibility and planning studies will commence; conversations will occur.timescales and planning resilience of the various scenarios that we discuss, the pre new normal as it relates to resilience is likely to be of a longer gestation period of transition than most others. as lockdowns were imposed, crisis management was inevitably the order of the day. emerging from those lockdowns, organisations are just as inevitably moving into the pre-new normal re-starting and then ramping-up production, gradually adapting and stabilising their operations, followed by a period of optimisation and improvement before returning to growth and the new normal. and somewhere along the way, opportunities are also likely to emerge. not only will the transitions take time, but when that new normal involves relocating production or sourcing in order to enhance resilience, that timescale is likely to become even more protracted. it takes time to build and equip factories, move and relocate production lines, and qualify and contract with manufacturers. industries will move through this process at different speeds: as a rough guide, the greater the capital investment involved, the longer the timescale.bear in mind, too, that it is not just a factory or production line that is moving: in most cases, it will be an entire supply chain, as well. nor can it be assumed that the newly configured supply chain that traditionally provided parts or materials will be available: former suppliers may have moved as well, or simply no longer be in business. in short, diversification often requires the development of completely new supply chain networks and infrastructure. in the other scenarios, the pre new normal is likely to be measured in months; for it takes time to build and equip factories, move and relocate production lines lasting lesson the last weeks and months let us suffer from the coronavirus pandemic, and sharpened our view towards some basic elements of our business. reliable supply chains are at least equal to our need for speed, having strong partnerships is better than having customer-client relations, and shared transparency is a key for successful supply chains. and what is more: we as logistics industry are a key element for our daily life in all aspects. let's act accordingly in the future and create together more value for social and industrial life. lessons from japan resilience perhaps the best model of what to expect is the automotive industry's response to the japanese earthquake and ensuing tsunami of 2011. this brought massive disruption, spreading far beyond the immediately-affected assembly plants of toyota, suzuki and nissan located in the disaster zone. but the industry quickly learned two important lessons. first, that auto-makers and manufacturers needed to know more about the physical locations of its tier-2, tier-3, and tier-4 suppliers, having discovered, too late, that many of them were clustered in the north-eastern corner of japan. and second, that single-sourcing carried risks when single-sourcing involved not just a single supplier, but a single factory. within hours of the disaster, the finely-honed supply chains of assembly and component plants elsewhere in japan were hit by parts shortages, spreading further disruption far beyond japan's own shores, affecting automakers as diverse as ford, volvo, gm, renault, chrysler, and psa peugeot citroen. lasting lesson in these volatile times, supply chain visibility and control have never been more important. control tower concepts and data analytics capabilities must be upgraded to meet new demand patterns, support growth opportunities, and manage greater external risks.the japanese earthquake of 2011 brought massive disruption, far beyond the immediately-affected assembly plants. executives map inventory locations and map supplier networks beyond where stock is held. focus not on tier 1 up to tier 3, focusing on stock value, but on the number of value-adding manufacturing and items and the duration of cover, i.e. distribution locations and the number of days of inventory , assess supplier health and held under a specific level of readiness, including business customer demand continuity plans and emergency. understand the supply chain are managed effectively across network flows: never assume that the supply chain. managing goods take the most direct route. relationships require processes, liaise with your logistics providers information systems and people resource. (re-)assess warehouse and distribution networks based on a new set of supply chain priorities, i.e. resilience, customer proximity and demand patterns, sales channels, supplier locations, etc. the xirallic tale for example, a metallic paint pigment called xirallic was produced at only one factory in the world, located in the japanese coastal town of onahama. xirallic, it turned out, was used by manufacturers as diverse as chrysler, toyota, general motors, ford, and volvo. in the event, it was to be eight weeks after the earthquake that production was eventually restored. no longer is xirallic sole-sourced: a spokesperson from the manufacturer (merck kgaa in germany) told reuters in 2016 that the company now keeps multi month stocks of xirallic at warehouses in japan and other regions around the world and in addition, a second production line was opened up, in germany in 2012.just-in-case replaces just-in-time demand. long before countries went into lockdown, their supermarket shelves were stripped bare. pasta, toilet paper, painkillers, canned tomatoes, flour all gone. and as the prospect of lockdown loomed, things got worse. across europe and north america, the story was the same. the closer lockdown loomed, the more consumers responded by panic-buying. in the end, lockdown, or even fears of lockdown-induced supply chain disruption, was no longer the trigger. people were panic-buying because other people were panic-buying. as a result, at each upstream link in the supply chain, orders were amplified, as buyers attempted to re-stock shelves. supermarket chains attempted to help by sharply pruning their ranges, so that manufacturers could conserve capacity by not switching from sku to sku. and yet actual food consumption barely moved. people weren't actually eating more flour or pasta or canned tomatoes. base consumption levels were largely unchanged. nor was this solely a consumer-related phenomenon. many industrial supply chains responded in a similar way: time and again, it has been shown that industry's favourite strategy in times of uncertainty is to stockpile as was most recently seen on both sides of the channel as brexit uncertainty peaked. even fears of lockdown induced supply chain disruption post-coronavirus recovery. lasting lesson in the new normal, if your supply chain is the same as the one that you had pre-coronavirus, you're probably doing something wrong. just-in-case replaces just-in-time demand as supply chain professionals know all too well, this is the bullwhip effect in action: just like a bullwhip, the amplitude of demand fluctuations increases as the distance from the origin increases. a small movement with the hand produces a significantly greater movement at the tail of the whip. the bullwhip effect, to a greater or lesser extent, is likely to be a feature of the post-coronavirus new normal. for consumers and businesses within consumer-based supply chains, just in case is likely to replace just in time. three factors may affect this change:  the bullwhip effect takes a considerable time to dampen down , social distancing and similar health protocols are likely to result in consumers making fewer (but larger) shopping trips to supermarkets and supply chains will be experiencing oscillations for months to come, as supply shortages and economic dislocation distort true underlying long-term demand.supply chains will be experiencing oscillations for months to come post-coronavirus . but what will true long-term underlying demand actually look like? post-coronavirus, the level of long-term aggregate consumer demand, which typically drives around two-thirds of a typical country's gdp, is difficult to predict. what is clear is that the new normal is likely to involve quite different patterns and priorities in what consumers are demanding. and industry, in turn, will mirror those differences. as an example of this, and particularly in the absence of a vaccine, consumers are likely to prioritise home-based activities over those that involve exposure to potentially risky social environments. visits to bars, restaurants, sports events and cinemas will be avoided or reduced, while home baking, do-it-yourself, watching television, and playing video games might well experience a surge in popularity. foreign vacations might be less popular, freeing up money for other activities and consumer goods. expenditure on healthcare and personal protection products such as masks, gloves and visors, is likely to increase, while elsewhere it will decline. in the absence of a vaccine, there will certainly be some impact on the distribution of expenditure as well as the total. nor is it solely consumer-facing supply chains that will be affected. across a variety of sectors, even though it is difficult to make precise predictions, it is likely that long-term demand patterns will be disrupted. power generation, oil consumption, the automotive industry, aircraft manufacture few sectors will be entirely immune. and not all the effects will necessarily be entirely adverse: the automotive industry, for instance, should see a greater demand for autonomous vehicles.lasting lesson safe and convenient, the pandemic has given online shopping a significant boost, accelerating its growth. but retailers, and their customers, must understand their true cost-to-serve so far, few do.it is likely that long-term demand patterns will be disrupted , transition to the pre-new normal demand , it will be a period of transition, during which long-term consumer demand starts to evolve, and during which businesses, and their supply chains, will need to be agile and responsive. use of online shopping so as to minimize face-to-face exposure to potentially risky retail environments. related data points hint at the landscape:  for europe, e-commerce volumes in may 2020 grew 89% versus last year. in europe`s largest e-commerce market, the uk, 24% of consumers suggest they will continue shopping as they do now once life returns to normal1 2022 uk-based supermarket retailer tesco's online sales grew 49% in q1 2020 and more than 90% in may, while overall group sales rose 8% 2022 and in the us, walmart's e-commerce sales grew 74% in q1 2020, while target's online sales grew 141% for its fiscal q1 end may 2020 .covid-19 impact on global b2c e-commerce and online payments a far cry, in short, from today's lockdown-induced extended lead times and shortages. it will also, if the predictions are borne out, be a period of recession, during which demand will be more fragile than would otherwise be the case. in general, it is reasonable to expect that the high-amplitude bullwhip effect that was in place at the start of lockdown will gradually diminish as economic activity returns, although not completely vanish. linked to this will be the likelihood of consumers buying through multiple channels, partly as they diversify their supply bases so as to maximize security of supply, and partly as they make more, there are signs that demand is weakening for higher-priced consumer technology. transition to the pre-new normal as example, for tesco the shift has come at a price, and the company's share price reflects the significant increase in associated costs that it has reported. the cost-to-serve of online groceries is significantly higher, eroding margins, with consumers accustomed to free or low-cost deliveries.more strategically, there are grounds for expecting online shopping to increase for other reasons than health concerns. given coronavirus-induced volatility in demand, and changing tastes, and given also the difficult trading environment posed by recessionary economic conditions, it is reasonable to expect a growth in direct-to-consumer selling, sidestepping normal retail channels, even in industries that have traditionally relied heavily on established retail channels to market. using the example of consumer technology, direct-to-consumer activity has hitherto been a relative rarity, associated with higher-priced manufacturers such as apple and bang & olufsen. exposure to direct-to-consumer sales to achieve similar levels of customer intimacy.seeing higher levels of customer intimacy enjoyed by brands with direct-to-consumer exposure trading relationships, other manufacturers may wish to increase their own there are grounds for expecting online shopping to increase."
Economist - How Snowflake Raised $3bn in a Record Software IPO (Sep-20).pdf,"Cloud-based data-warehousing platform Snowflake had its blockbuster IPO on September 16th. Despite an expected range of $100-$110, Snowflake shares were initially priced at $120 and gained 112% in its 2nd day of trading due to strong demand. The IPO raised nearly $3.4B, easily making it the largest software IPO ever. Snowflake closed on September 28th at a valuation near $70B and is expected to grow revenue 173% in 2020. Snowflakes solution enables customers to run analytics across all their data with multi-cloud compatibility and can add capacity as needed rather than paying a fixed license fee. It also recently set up a data exchange with 13 categories and 200+ data listings, including OSM layers and POIs  a potential competitor to HEREs marketplace.","catching snowflakes is fun. it is about to become lucrative. many investors will scramble for shares in snowflake, a maker of database programs, when it goes public on the new york stock exchange on september 16th. it is expected to be the largest ever initial public offering of a software company, raising around $3bn and valuing the eight-year-old firm at about $30bn. even warren buffett, abandoning his customary tech-shyness, wants in on the action. the legendary investor's conglomerate, berkshire hathaway, is investing more than $600m in the firm, through a separate private placement and by purchasing shares from a former chief executive. the excitement shines a light on an obscure corner of the information-technology ecosystem: software for managing corporate data. this database market already generates $55bn a year in sales. it is expected to expand rapidly as data become if not the new oil, then at least an important input for most companies. and it is changing in intriguing ways, not all of them good news for snowflake. a database used to be best understood as a digital steam engine. before electricity came along, a factory's machines sat near a single power source. similarly, corporate applications programs that keep track of a firm's finances or its supply chain, for example were built around databases that housed all of a firm's important information. hard disks were pricey and had limited capacity so the best way to store it was in lean relational databases. max schireson, who used to run mongodb, a database maker, and now works for battery ventures, an investment firm, likens these to a parking garage where, to save space, you put all the seats in one place, the tyres in another and so on. the industry quickly became dominated by a few firms, with oracle leading the pack. as storage has grown cheaper and data volumes have exploded, however, so has the number of startups erecting new kinds of digital carpark. many focus not on tracking specific transactions but on analysing all manner of a firm's data to glean relevant knowledge about its business, such as where certain products sell best. these more cluttered data warehouses, as they are known, were pioneered in the late 1970s by a firm called teradata. their latest iteration are data lakes, which take in all sorts of unstructured information, including text and pictures. snowflake has gone a step further. it was one of the first firms to lift both the data stockpiles and the software to trawl them from companies2019 in-house data centres and into the computing clouds, the biggest of which are operated by amazon, google and microsoft, a trio of tech giants. snowflake's customers can add capacity as needed and pay depending on their use rather than a fixed price for a software licence, as was typical for relational databases. better yet, its multi-cloud service works across the big three computing clouds, so customers need not get locked into any one of them. recently snowflake has also added features that let customers share and sell data, setting itself up as a data exchange of sorts. this has convinced many that snowflake could be the next oracle. the firm is certainly on a roll. although it is not yet making money, its losses, of $171m in the six months to july, have declined even as revenue has more than doubled year on year, to $242m. on current trends sales could reach nearly $1bn in the next 12 months. despite these promising numbers, and mr buffett's blessing, snowflake has its work cut out. the company's uniqueness will not last much longer, says donald feinberg of gartner, a research firm. rival firms, in particular the big cloud providers, have been beefing up competing products and even dabbled with the multi-cloud. a few startups are already offering cheaper and more flexible open source alternatives such as clickhouse, a particularly zippy data-management system developed by a startup called altinity. other challengers are building more specialised digital repositories. data generated by websites, for instance, are often stored on document-oriented databases that, in the garage analogy, keep cars intact rather than strip them for parts. mongodb is the market leader in this segment. confluent, another startup, is big in streaming databases that garner information from sources like sensors. these are more akin to a motorway service station: data are quickly checked to see if action is needed. much as today's assembly lines are driven by dispersed electric motors rather than a single steam engine, then, corporate it systems will increasingly rely on sundry specialised databases, predicts zane chrane of bernstein, a broker. that and the fact that data will increasingly be analysed in real time, rather than saved in a conventional database2014will limit the power and profits of any single supplier. so snowflake is unlikely ever to become as dominant as oracle. snowflakes fly high in a flurry. they also melt.

Economist - Pandemic May Create Productivity Growth (Dec-20).pdf,"Global productivity growth has been sluggish for the past decade but could accelerate as the pandemic has forced creative, new uses of existing technologies. Productivity lags investment in technologies with broad applicability, like digitization and automation, because it takes time to figure out how to use them to best effect. Office closures and social distancing have accelerated the organizational overhauls needed to make better use of these technologies, and firms will retain and build on them as COVID-19 recedes.","reasons to be cheerful , the pandemic could give way to an era of rapid productivity growth , businesses have adopted new processes and technologies and there are signs that they may pay off the economist finance. the prospects for a productivity resurgence may seem grim. after all, the past decade has featured plenty of technological fatalism: in 2013 peter thiel, a venture capitalist, mused of the technological advances of the moment that we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters. robert gordon, of northwestern university, has echoed this sentiment, speculating that humanity might never again invent something so transformative as the flush toilet. throughout the decade, productivity data largely supported the views of the pessimists. what is more, some studies of past pandemics and analyses of the economic effects of this one suggest that covid-19 is if anything likely to make the prevailing productivity picture worse. according to the world bank, countries struck by pandemic outbreaks in the 21st century (not including covid) experienced a decline in labour productivity of 9% after three years relative to unaffected countries. and yet, stranger things have happened. the brutal years of the 1930s were followed by the most extraordinary economic boom in history. a generation ago, economists had very nearly abandoned hope of ever matching the post-war performance when a computer-powered productivity explosion took place. and today, once more, there are tantalising hints that the economic and social traumas of the first two decades of this century may soon give way to a new period of economic dynamism. productivity is the magic elixir of economic growth. while increases in the size of the labour force or the stock of capital can raise output, the effect of such contributions diminishes unless better ways are found to make use of those resources. productivity growth wringing more output from available resources is the ultimate source of long-run increases in incomes. it's not everything, as paul krugman, a nobel economics laureate, once noted, but in the long run it's almost everything. economists know less about how to boost productivity than they would like, however. increases in labour productivity (that is, more output per worker per hour) seem to follow improvements in educational levels, increases in investment (which raise the level of capital per worker), and adoption of new innovations. a rise in total factor productivity or the efficiency with which an economy uses its productive inputs may require the discovery of new ways of producing goods and services, or the reallocation of scarce resources from low-productivity firms and places to high-productivity ones. globally, productivity growth decelerated sharply in the 1970s from scorchingly high rates in the post-war decades. a burst of higher productivity growth in the rich world, led by america, unfolded from the mid-1990s into the early 2000s. emerging markets, too, enjoyed rapid productivity growth in the decade prior to the global financial crisis, powered by high levels of investment and an expansion of trade which brought more sophisticated techniques and technologies to the developing-economy participants in global supply chains. since the crisis, however, a broad-based and stubbornly persistent slowdown in productivity growth has set in (see chart 1). about 70% of the world's economies have been affected, according to the world bank. accounting for the slowdown is a fraught process. the world bank reckons that slowing trade growth and fewer opportunities to adopt and adapt new technology from richer countries may have helped depress productivity advances in the emerging world. across all economies, sluggish investment in the aftermath of the global financial crisis looks a culprit: a particular problem in places with ageing and shrinking workforces. yet while these headwinds surely matter, the bigger question is why seemingly powerful new technologies like improved robotics, cloud computing and artificial intelligence have not prompted more investment and higher productivity growth. broadly speaking, three hypotheses compete to explain these doldrums. one, voiced by the techno-pessimists, insists that for all the enthusiasm about world-changing technologies, recent innovations are simply not as transformative as the optimists insist. though this may turn out to be correct, continued technological progress makes it look ever less plausible as an explanation for doldrums. ai may not have transformed the world economy at the dramatically disruptive pace some expected five to ten years ago, but it has become significantly, and in some cases startlingly, more capable. gpt-3, a language prediction model developed by openai, a research firm, has demonstrated a remarkable ability to carry on conversations, draft long texts and write code in surprisingly human-like fashion. though the potential of the web to support an economy in which the constraints of distance do not bind has long underwhelmed, cloud computing and video-conferencing proved their economic worth over the past year, enabling vast amounts of productive activity to continue with scarcely an interruption despite the shuttering of many offices. new technologies are clearly able to do more than has generally been asked of them in recent years. that strengthens the case for a second explanation for slow productivity growth: chronically weak demand. in this view, expressed most vociferously by larry summers of harvard university, governments' inability to stoke enough spending constrains investment and growth. more public investment is needed to unlock the economy's potential. chronically low rates of interest and inflation, limp private investment, and lackluster age growth since the turn of the millennium clearly indicate that demand has been inadequate for most of the past two decades. whether this meaningfully undercuts productivity growth is difficult to say. but in the years before the pandemic, as unemployment fell and wage growth ticked up, amAmericanabour productivity growth appeared to be accelerating, from an annual increase of just 0.3% in 2016 to a rise of 1.7% in 2019: the fastest pace of growth since 2010. advertising but a third explanation provides the strongest case for optimism: it takes time to work out how to use powerful new technologies effectively. ai is an example of what economists call a 201cgeneral-purpose technology201d, like electricity, which has the potential to boost productivity across many industries. but making best use of such technologies takes time and experimentation. this accumulation of know-how is really an investment in intangible capital. recent work by erik brynjolfsson and daniel rock, of mit, and chad sySyverson of the university of chicago, argue that this pattern leads to a phenomenon they call the productivity j-curve. as new technologies are first adopted, firms shift resources toward investment in intangibles: developing new business processes. this shift in resources means that firm output suffers in a way that cannot be fully explained by shifts in the measured use of lalabor and tangible capital, and which is thus interpreted as a decline in productivity growth. later, as intangible investments bear fruit, measured productivity surges because output rockets upward in a manner unexplained by measured inputs of labor and tangible capital. back in 2010, the failure to account for intangible investment in software made little difference to the productivity numbers, the authors reckon. but productivity has increasingly been understated; by the end of 2016, productivity growth was likely about 0.9 percentage points higher than official estimates suggested. this pattern has occurred before. in 1987, robert solow, another nobel prize winner, remarked that computers could be seen everywhere except the productivity statistics. nine years later, american productivity growth began a ten-year acceleration which evoked the golden economic age of the 1950s and 1960s. these processes are not always sexy. in the late 1990s, the soaring stock prices of flashy internet start-ups earned most of the headlines. the fillip to productivity growth had other sources, like improvements in advanced manufacturing techniques, better inventory management and rationalisation of logistics and production processes made possible by the digitisation of firm records and the deployment of clever software. the j-curve provides a way to reconcile tech optimism and adoption of new technologies with lousy productivity statistics. the role of intangible investments in unlocking the potential of new technologies may also mean that the pandemic, despite its economic damage, has made a productivity boom more likely to develop. office closures have forced firms to invest in digitisation and automation, or to make better use of existing investments. old analogue habits could no longer be tolerated. though it will not show up in any economic statistics, in 2020 executives around the world invested in the organisational overhauls needed to make new technologies work effectively (see chart 2). not all of these efforts will have led to productivity improvements relative to the pre-pandemic norm. but as covid-19 recedes, the firms which did transform their activities will retain and build on their new ways of doing things. the crisis forced change early evidence suggests that some transformations are very likely to stick, and that the pandemic quickened the pace of technology adoption. a survey of global firms conducted by the world economic forum this year found that more than 80% of employers intend to accelerate plans to digitize their processes and provide more opportunities for remote work, while 50% plan to accelerate automation of production tasks. about 43% expect changes like these to generate a net reduction in their workforces: a development which could pose labor-market challenges but which almost by definition implies productivity improvements. harder to assess but no less realistic is the possibility that the movement of so much work into the cloud could have productivity-boosting effects at the level of national economies or globally. high housing and real-estate costs in rich, productive cities have locked firms and workers out of places where they might have done more with less resources. if tech workers can more easily contribute to top firms while living in affordable cities away from america's coasts, then strict zoning rules in the bay area of california will become less of a bottleneck. office space in san francisco or london freed up by increases in remote work could then be occupied by firms which really do need their workers to operate in close physical proximity. beyond that, and politics permitting, the boost to distance education and telemedicine delivered by the pandemic could help unlock a new period of growth in services trade, and the achievement of economies of scale in sectors which have long proved resistant to productivity-boosting measures. none of this can be taken for granted. making the most of new private-sector investments in technology and know-how will require governments to engineer a rapid recovery in demand, to make complementary investments in public goods like broadband, and to focus on addressing the educational shortfalls so many students have suffered as a consequence of school closures. but the raw materials for a new productivity boom appear to be falling into place, in a way not seen for at least two decades. this year's darkness may in fact mean that dawn is just over the horizon.

Eurostat - European Union Q3 GDP Analysis (Oct-20).pdf,"Dark economic clouds are appearing on the horizon again as the pandemics second wave spreads across Europe, causing governments to institute partial lock downs. Eurostat Q3 GDP data shows the European economy surged back to growth following the spring shutdown, with the fastest expansion in its history between July and September 2020. While Q3 did not fully make up losses earlier in the year, recovery has been strong in spite of the ongoing pandemic. This suggests potential for a swift economic recovery once the pandemic is eventually brought under control, however, the road will be bumpy.","30 October 2020 preliminary flash estimate for the third quarter of 2020 GDP up by 12.7% in the euro area and by 12.1% in the EU -4.3% and -3.9% respectively compared with the third quarter of 2019 in the third quarter 2020, seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 12.7% in the euro area and by 12.1% in the EU, compared with the previous quarter, according to a preliminary flash estimate published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European union. these were by far the sharpest increases observed since time series started in 1995, and a rebound compared to the second quarter of 2020, when GDP had decreased by 11.8% in the euro area and by 11.4% in the EU. these preliminary GDP flash estimates are based on data sources that are incomplete and subject to further revisions. compared with the same quarter of the previous year, seasonally adjusted GDP has however decreased by 4.3% in the euro area and by 3.9% in the EU in the third quarter of 2020, which represents a partial recovery after -14.8% and -13.9% respectively in the previous quarter.

German imports from the United Kingdom were down 24.8% to 2.4 billion euros. Methodological note: the differing comparative periods must be taken into account in all press releases on short-term indicators. short-term economic monitoring usually focuses on comparisons with the previous month or previous quarter. these reflect short-term economic trends. a comparison with the previous month/previous quarter can only be meaningfully interpreted if the data have been seasonally adjusted. a comparison with the previous year is intended to offer a long-term comparison of levels and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations. during the current coronavirus crisis, the strong decreases especially in march/May 2020 and the slowly emerging recovery may produce highly different results for the comparison with the previous month/previous quarter and the comparison with the previous year. both of the two perspectives are important: what is the short-term economic trend compared with the previous month/previous quarter, and how far has the catching-up process gone compared with the previous year’s level? in order to provide also a direct comparison with the pre-crisis level, all press releases on short-term indicators available in seasonally adjusted form now include a comparison with February 2020 or the 4 quarter of 2019.

International Energy Agency - Global EV Outlook (Jun-20).pdf,"The annual EV Outlook explores developments in global electric mobility. By combining historical analysis with projections to 2030, key areas of interest are examined such as EV and charging infrastructure deployment, ownership cost, energy use, carbon dioxide emissions and battery material demand. In this years edition, a special analysis evaluates the impact of Covid-19 in EV markets and finds that government responses to the crisis will ultimately contribute to determining the outcome of electric car markets in 2020 and beyond.","global ev outlook 2020 entering the decade of electric drive? abstract the global ev outlook is an annual publication that identifies and discusses recent developments in electric mobility across the globe. it is developed with the support of the members of the electric vehicles initiative (evi). Combining historical analysis with projections to 2030, the report examines key areas of interest such as electric vehicle and charging infrastructure deployment, ownership cost, energy use, carbon dioxide emissions and battery material demand. this edition features case studies on transit bus electrification in Kolkata (India), Shenzhen (china), Santiago (chile) and Helsinki (Finland). the report includes policy recommendations that incorporate learning from frontrunner markets to inform policy makers and stakeholders that consider policy frameworks and market systems for electric vehicle adoption. this edition also features an update on the performance and costs of batteries. it further extends the life cycle analysis conducted in global ev outlook 2019, assessing the technologies and policies that will be needed to ensure that ev battery end-of-life treatment contributes to the fullest extent to sustainability and co2 emissions reductions objectives. finally, it analyses how off-peak electricity demand charging, dynamic controlled charging (v1g) and vehicle-to-grid (v2g) could mitigate the impact of eves on peak demand, facilitate the integration of variable renewables and reduce electricity generation capacity needs. page the global electric vehicle fleet expanded significantly over the last decade, underpinned by supportive policies and technology advances global sales of passenger cars were sluggish in 2019, but electric cars had another banner year. sales of electric cars topped 2.1 million globally in 2019, surpassing 2018 already a record year to boost the stock to 7.2 million electric cars. 1 electric cars, which accounted for 2.6% of global car sales and about 1% of global car stock in 2019, registered a 40% year-on-year increase. as technological progress in the electrification of two/three-wheelers, buses, and trucks advances and the market for them grows, electric vehicles are expanding significantly. ambitious policy announcements have been critical in stimulating the electric-vehicle rollout in major vehicle markets in recent years. in 2019, indications of a continuing shift from direct subsidies to policy approaches that rely more on regulatory and other structural measures including zero-emission vehicles mandates and fuel economy standards have set clear, long-term signals to the auto industry and consumers that support the transition in an economically sustainable manner for governments. 1 in this report, electric car or passenger electric car refers to either a battery electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle in the passenger light-duty vehicle segment. it does not include hybrid electric vehicles that cannot be plugged-in. Electric cars, which expanded by an annual average of 60% in the 2014-19 period, totaled 7.2 million in 2019. after entering commercial markets in the first half of the decade, electric car sales have soared. only about 17,000 electric cars were on the world’s roads in 2010. by 2019, that number had swelled to 7.2 million, 47% of which were in the people’s republic of china (china). nine countries had more than 100000 electric cars on the road. at least 20 countries reached market shares above 1%.  the 2.1 million electric car sales in 2019 represent a 6% growth from the previous year, down from year-on-year sales growth at least above 30% since 2016. three underlying reasons explain this trend:  car markets contracted. total passenger car sales volumes were depressed in many key countries. in the 2010s, fast-growing markets such as china and India for all types of vehicles had lower sales in 2019 than in 2018. against this backdrop of sluggish sales in 2019, the 2.6% market share of electric cars in worldwide car sales constitutes a record. in particular, china (at 4.9%) and Europe (at 3.5%) achieved new records in electric vehicle market share in 2019. market share is defined in this report as the share of new ev registrations as a percentage of total new vehicle registrations, whereas stock share refers to the share of electric vehicle stock as a percentage of total passenger vehicle stock. Purchase subsidies were reduced in key markets. china cut electric car purchase subsidies by about half in 2019 (as part of a gradual phase out of direct incentives set out in 2016). the us federal tax credit programmed ran out for key electric vehicle automakers such as general motors and tesla (the tax credit is applicable up to a 200 000 sales cap per automaker). these actions contributed to a significant drop in electric car sales in china in the second half of 2019, and a 10% drop in the united states over the year. with 90% of global electric car sales concentrated in china, Europe and the united states, this affected global sales and overshadowed the notable 50% sales increase in Europe in 2019, thus slowing the growth trend. Consumer expectations of further technology improvements and new models. Today’s consumer profile in the electric car market is evolving from early adopters and technophile purchasers to mass adoption. significant improvements in technology and a wider variety of electric car models on offer have stimulated consumer purchase decisions. the 2018-19 versions of some common electric car models display a battery energy density that is 20-100% higher than were their counterparts in 2012. further, battery costs have decreased by more than 85% since 2010. the delivery of new mass-market models such as the tesla model 3 caused a spike in sales in 2018 in key markets such as the united states. automakers have announced a diversified menu of electric cars, many of which are expected in 2020 or 2021. for the next five years, automakers have announced plans to release another 200 new electric car models, many of which are in the popular sport utility vehicle market segment. as improvements in technical performance and cost reductions continue, consumers are placed in the position of being attracted to a product but wondering if it would be wise to wait for the latest and greatest model. the covid-19 pandemic will affect global electric vehicle markets, although to a lesser extent than it will the overall passenger car market. based on car sales data during January to April 2020, our current estimate is that the passenger car market will contract by 15% over the year relative to 2019, while electric sales for passenger and commercial light-duty vehicles will remain broadly at 2019 levels. second waves of the pandemic and slower-than-expected economic recovery could lead to different outcomes, as well as to strategies for automakers to cope with regulatory standards. overall, we estimate that electric car sales will account for about 3% of global car sales in 2020. this outlook is underpinned by supporting policies, particularly in china and Europe. both markets have national and local subsidy schemes in place 2013 china recently extended its subsidy scheme until 2022. china and Europe also recently strengthened and extended their new energy vehicle mandate and co2 emissions standards, respectively.

KPMG - CEOs Accelerating Digital Transformation During Pandemic (Sep-20).pdf,"The COVID-19 crisis is making demands of CEOs that few could have imagined just months ago. Hundreds of CEOs across the globe were interviewed  first in January and again in late summer  to capture shifted priorities in the wake of the pandemic. Three key themes emerged: Recruitment strategies are evolving as remote working has widened the potential talent pool, loss of talent has risen as the most significant threatto growth, and major bets on digital transformation have accelerated.","the covid-19 crisis is making demands of ceos that few people could have predicted just months ago, and in many ways, has already redefined leadership. every person, business and country has somehow been impacted by this pandemic, and all are at different stages. for many, uncertainty is the only certainty.in an effort to bring some clarity to the complex world we find ourselves in, kpmg interviewed hundreds of ceos from many of the world's largest companies, first in january and then again in july and august, to get their perspectives and understand how their priorities have changed. we asked about their confidence in the future and examined how they are approaching this once-in-a-generation crisis. not surprisingly, the ceos we interviewed in this groundbreaking study are less confident about global economic growth than they were at the beginning of the year. but growth projections and output measurements don't tell bill thomas the whole story. corporate leaders have had to recalibrate their priorities and many have focused on what matters.with the real fears of an overturned marketplace, ceos are acting decisively across their entire organization. business leaders have told us they are accelerating their company's digital transformation and working to ensure their talent pipelines can adapt to meet new demands. they are renewing or revamping their corporate purpose so their organizations can contribute solutions to the many problems the world faces.together, it's a lot to do for any leader, especially on an expedited timeframe, and i would like to thank all the business leaders we talked to for taking the time to participate. with their help, we've uncovered some important trends and insights in this report that we hope you will find just as interesting as we do.kpmg initially surveyed 1,300 ceos in january and february, before many key markets were beginning to feel the full impact of lockdowns. then, in july and early august, we conducted a follow-up survey of 315 ceos to understand how thinking has evolved. key developments include:talent and a new working reality:businesses are looking to change their recruitment strategies as remote working has widened their potential talent pool and companies may be rethinking their office space in the short-term while also considering the future of work.shifting risk agenda:since the start of the pandemic, talent risk has risen to be named as the most significant threat to the growth of their businesses ahead of supply chain risk and a return to territorialism.digital acceleration:business leaders are betting on major dimensions of digital transformation and the majority have seen this accelerate during the lockdown.key findings overall, three key themes emerged from this year's survey, which we characterize as purpose, prosperity and priorities.purpose in the midst of a health and humanitarian crisis, ceos are focused on creating trusted, purposeful organizations that address critical societal challenges.prosperity as well as crisis response, ceos are positioning their businesses for long-term growth and prosperity.a renewed sense of purpose at the beginning of the year, 77 percent of ceos said the primary objective of their organization was purpose or societal driven, and today 79 percent say they feel a stronger emotional connection to their organization's purpose since the crisis began.from empathy to action 39 percent have had their health, or the health of one of their family, affected by covid-19, and 55 percent changed their strategic response to the pandemic as a result.standing up for equality in early 2020, 65 percent said that the public is looking to businesses to fill the void on societal challenges and today 81 percent are introducing new anti-black racism measures.growing in adversity today, around one-third (32 percent) say they are less confident now about prospects for long-term global economic growth than they were at the start of the year.accelerating digital growth 80 percent say the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation, with the biggest advance in digital operations, where 30 percent say that progress has put them years ahead of where they would have expected to be right now. the talent premium 2018talent risk2019 rises 11 places since the beginning of the year to be the number 1 threat to long-term growth.5prioritiesceos are doubling down on transformation priorities to build the capabilities needed to win in the post-covid future.leaning in to esg 71 percent say they want to lock-in climate change gains made as a result of the pandemic, with 65 percent saying that managing climate-related risks will play a part in whether they keep their jobs or not over the next 5 years.future of work 77 percent say they will continue to build on the digital collaboration and communication tools that are being used as a result of the pandemic, and 73 percent believe that remote working has widened their available talent pool.customer-centric supply chain 67 percent say they have had to rethink their global supply chain approach given the disruptive impact of the pandemic, driven by the desire to become more agile in response to changing customer needs. 79 percent have had to re-evaluate their purpose as a result of covid-19 to better address the needs of their stakeholders with profound consequences for people's health and livelihoods 2014 as well as the future of companies and industries 2014 the pandemic has presented ceos with the greatest possible test of their leadership abilities and personal resilience. chief executives of the world's largest organizations are using this unparalleled moment in history to lead with increased purpose and impact, both societal and economic. they are leading with empathy and humanity as they prioritize talent and corporate responsibility, finding opportunity amid a fall in global economic confidence, and rewiring their businesses for tomorrow's new reality. a renewed sense of purpose at the beginning of the year, we found that most ceos were seeing the primary objective of their organization shift from purely profit to also consider their purpose in society. less than a quarter (23 percent) saw the organization's overall objective in narrow 2018managing for shareholder value terms, with 54 percent taking a broader, purpose-driven approach focused on multiple stakeholders. furthermore, one in five (22 percent) say that their primary objective is to improve society. more recently, as chart 1 shows, purpose has helped ceos understand what needs to be done to meet the needs of stakeholders during the crisis, from employees to communities. for alison rose, group ceo at natwest group 2014 one of the oldest in the uk 2014 purpose has, among other things, guided the response to their customers. purpose means listening really carefully to what customers are going through and ensuring we're giving them the right support and being responsible lenders, she says. we put dedicated phone lines in for vulnerable customers and nhs (national health service) workers so that we can offer our help. we have a proactive calling program that reaches out to our most vulnerable customers, contacting over 300,000 of them. on the employee front, purpose means being aware of the support that her people need with the shift to wholesale working-from-home. for leaders, there's a greater obligation to be more visible, empathetic and engaged, because you need to show you understand the impact on everybody's life, she explains. everyone is dealing with challenges, not just in their work environment, but also in their personal life.1: in light of the pandemic, ceos believe that purpose is more powerful and relevant than ever 79% say they feel a stronger emotional connection to their  corporate purpose since the crisis began.77% say their purpose has helped them understand what they need to do to meet the needs of stakeholders: employees, communities, customers, partners and investors.77% say their purpose provides a clear framework for making quick and effective covid-19 related decisions.has become central pillar for ceos: 79 percent say they feel a stronger emotional connection to their corporate purpose since the crisis began. at the same time, however, the massive disruptive impact of the pandemic has caused many ceos to question whether their current purpose really meets the needs of stakeholders. in fact, 79 percent say they have had to re-evaluate their purpose as a result of covid-19. carefully listening to different stakeholders and encouraging dialogue, will be an important element of this re-evaluation, particularly if it becomes clear that the current purpose needs to be adjusted to better meet the needs of a stakeholder group.from empathy to actionthis increasingly personal and emotional connection to purpose during the pandemic reflects the fact that ceos face similar health and family challenges as their people and communities. in fact, well over a third of chief executives (39 percent) have had their health, or the health of one of their family, affected by covid-19.the pandemic will be remembered by many as a defining moment for this generation. ceos are clearly determined to learn from the pandemic and their own personal experience to recalibrate and make not only the best-informed decisions, but also the most authentic ones. as chart 2 shows, out of those who were personally affected by the health implications of the crisis, only 4 percent made no change to their approach to the pandemic. in all, 55 percent changed their strategic response, either completely or to some degree. another 40 percent, while not changing their strategy, did pay more attention to the human aspect of the pandemic. for leaders, there's a greater obligation to be more visible, empathetic, and engaged, because you need to show you understand the impact on everybody's life. how ceos changed their response to the pandemic as a result of having their health, or a member of their family's health, affectedmy

people is critical to protect his employees2019 well-being during the crisis and build a robust and motivated workforce for the future. at zurich, this focus on protecting people's health translates into concrete actions. for example, the company offered on a voluntary basis testing for employees and their families. the leadership challenge of the crisis is the sense of responsibility you have for protecting your people from health issues, he says. this begins with reducing risk. as i have told my people many times  no one joins an insurance company thinking that it comes with a life risk. today's crisis also requires compassionate people leadership to address employees deep-seated fears and anxieties. normally, if you meet people in a work situation, you talk business. today, though, people are fearful about what the future holds for them and their families. today, you need to be a people leader above all else.up for equality at the beginning of the year, we found that ceos were increasingly prepared to personally lead the way in tackling society's major challenges. around two-thirds (65 percent) said that the public is looking to businesses to fill the void on societal challenges. at the same time, 76 percent said they had a personal responsibility to be a leader for change on societal issues. during the pandemic, there are numerous examples of companies playing a significant role in their country's response, from developing products and services for front-line workers to financial contributions. at hellenic petroleum one of greece's largest refiners and traders of petroleum products .ceo andreas shiamishis had a number of priorities when it came to addressing the pandemic, including protecting his workforce, operational continuity and working capital. however, supporting society as it dealt with the crisis was also a major focus.as a starting point, hellenic petroleum made a significant financial donation to greece's national health system, with the monies earmarked for much-needed medical equipment and supplies. but as well as its financial donation, hellenic's actions also strengthened the country's ability to deal with the crisis. we were nearly the only organization that from day one was focused on the testing of covid, he says. in early march, we had already placed orders for very efficient testing equipment. by importing them early, we doubled the country's capacity for tests. he sees this contribution as critical to cementing the strong bond between hellenic and its communities. we supported local communities through disinfection programs and various health and medical support initiatives, he explains. all in all,this reconfirmed our contribution and re-enforced the strong bond between our company and the community.76 percent said at the beginning of the year, they had a personal responsibility to be a leader for change on societal issues we supported local communities through disinfection programs and various health and medical support initiatives. all in all, this reconfirmed our contribution and re-enforced the strong bond between our company and the community. 81 percent of ceos say their organization has already or plans to publicly announce new anti-black racism measures being able to draw on a diverse spectrum of talent is critical to addressing the unique challenges of the pandemic, and ceos are looking to strengthen their anti-discrimination approaches. in the wake of widespread protests following the death of george floyd on 25 may, 81 percent have either publicly announced new anti-black racism measures in 2020 or plan to do so in the near term. for verizon communications2018 chairman and ceo hans vestberg, playing a critical role in tackling racial inequality was a logical extension of the company's approach to major societal issues, its strategy, and its leadership philosophy. when i have opinions about societal challenges, it's when it's part of my strategy,he explains. i was always an extremely strong advocate for diversity and inclusion. i've lived and worked in four continents, and i've learned that if you have seven people like me in the room, it's just going to be a disaster. diversity and inclusion is one of our leadership philosophies and part of our credo as a company, and so talking about it comes very naturally for us.hans vestberg, who was visibly emotional in a video announcement to his staff where he announced verizon was committing us$10 million to organizations that are dedicated to racial equality and social justice, believes that a strong stance is a moral imperative if you find something simply unacceptable. we knew racial injustice was something we needed to talk about because we2019re not going to accept it,he says. we're really building diversity right here: our customer base is diverse and our company is diverse. for ceos who had already introduced new diversity and anti-racism measures the top three areas actioned were:1 performance management , 2 external interventions, such as donations , 3 supportive interventions, such as allyship training linking anti-racism measures to performance objectives can be used to set specific and measurable diversity targets and can ensure that supporting equity in the workplace is the responsibility of all leaders and managers. we knew racial injustice was something we needed to talk about because we're not going to accept it. growing in adversity the survey finds that the covid-19 crisis has shaken ceo confidence in global economic growth. today, around one-third (32 percent) say they are less confident now about prospects for global growth over the next 3 years than they were at the start of the year. however, this loss of confidence is not as dramatic when ceos consider what the future holds for their companies, with only 17 percent less confident today. they are clearly more confident in mastering their own company's fortunes, where they have more control and levers of influence. we saw earlier ceos are more confident in their own businesses' growth prospects over the coming 3 years. in part, this is because they have greater control over the levers that will determine this. one of the most critical levers they can control here, and a major growth driver, is digital acceleration. with commerce increasingly taking place online because of factors such as physical distancing, companies are having to rethink what customers want and how to deliver. we found that 75 percent of ceos say the pandemic has accelerated the creation of a seamless digital customer experience, with over 1 in 5 (22 percent) of those saying progress has sharply accelerated, putting us years in advance of where we expected to be. digital transformation was already central to its growth strategy and operating model. but, as ceo steve hasker explains, shifts in customer attitudes and behaviors has accelerated its digital business model strategy. with our customers, we've seen a major change in the acceptance of cloud-based, real-time, digitally delivered business information services, he says. any resistance in our clients mindsets to moving to the cloud or the next generation of digital solutions has largely, if not entirely, evaporated. i think we've seen 3 to 4 years of progress in just 3 to 4 months, in terms of acceptance of what the new world needs to look like.any resistance in our clients' mindsets to moving to the cloud or the next generation of digital solutions has largely, if not entirely, evaporated. steve hasker president and ceo thomson reuters goodburn, global head of advisory, kpmg international, points out that as well as driving customer-focused growth, digital technologies are a critical element of resiliance allowing, for example, greater operational flexibility in the face of disruption. we can see that organizations are increasing their investment in digital transformation to future proof their businesses, he says. ceos continue to scrutinize how to digitalize operations and how technological advancements can serve as accelerators in customer experience and employee engagement. the challenge for organizations is to focus efforts and investment on the areas that are capable of generating the most long-term value, while avoiding those areas that might just prove to be a short-term reaction to the pandemic. when we asked ceos to name the greatest challenge they have faced in accelerating digital transformation, the biggest issue was lack of insight into future operational scenarios. companies need to understand whether a covid-related change such as shifting customer behaviors is evidence of a permanent trend that is emerging rather than just a temporary effect of the pandemic.shifting risks as they plan their path to long-term growth, business leaders recognize that there have been new challenges to contend with during the lockdown. a potential second wave of covid-19 in their key markets would likely deepen these concerns, with further adverse consequences in terms of retaining key employees, hiring talent and keeping their workforces productive.in january, ceos ranked talent risk behind 11 other risks to growth. however, since the start of the pandemic, talent risk has risen to be named as the most significant threat to their businesses ahead of supply chain, the threat of a return to territorialism and environmental risk (see chart 5).supply chain risk has accelerated up the agenda from its ninth-placed position at the beginning of the year it now occupies second place as a major strategic threat. even before covid-19, supply chain risk was in the spotlight as a result of increasing volatility, be it trade tensions or extreme climate-driven events. however, the pandemic has brought this issue into even sharper relief, as organizations desperately sought to maintain supply chain continuity in the midst of worldwide lockdowns.building resilient, flexible supply chains ones that can withstand shocks and offer the agility to pivot to new opportunities will be critical for organizations to drive growth and build a competitive advantage post-covid. this will be particularly important in a world where ceos are aware that increasing territorialism which is their third-placed risk today could make the transfer of goods both more difficult and more costly. we look further into this issue in the customer-centric supply chain section. the leadership challenge of the crisis is the sense of responsibility you have for protecting your people from health issues. gary reader, global head of clients & markets, kpmg international, points out that while major risks have not disappeared, human or talent risk has assumed new importance in what is both a humanitarian and economic crisis. this year's report highlights that human and operational risks have been given greater priority by senior executives as a result of the pandemic. geopolitical, tax, operational and regulatory challenges have not ceased to exist, but ceos recognize that losing key employees and attracting specialized talent can have a critical impact on future business performance. many leadership teams are concerned about the mental and physical wellbeing of their staff, but also recognize that unless they manage this properly, growth will likely be stunted.managing talent risk requires that ceos both focus on the now and the long-term future. today, ceos are acutely aware that talent will be key to driving long-term growth and building an organization that can thrive in a new reality. new digital talents will be needed to meet changing customer behaviors and needs. as automation of the operating model accelerates, upskilling and reskilling will be critical for people's employability and effectiveness. to build a new organization, people's willingness to learn continuously and their adaptability will be increasingly important attributes. developing new learning content and delivering it virtually will be a critical step.at kyocera corporation an electronics and ceramics manufacturer that is one of japan's most successful companies a determination to focus on talented employees is second nature and underpins a unique management philosophy. chairman goro yamaguchi explains how the employee-centric philosophy of the company's founder, kazuo inamori, a celebrated japanese business leader and management thinker, still permeates the organization today, over 60 years on from kyocera's founding in 1959. our founder kazuo inamori came up with the kyocera philosophy soon after the company's founding, and has been disseminating this philosophy to all employees from when the company was still small up to the present day, he explains. the philosophy is based on our management rationale, which is to provide opportunities for the material and intellectual growth of all our employees, and through our joint efforts, contribute to the advancement of society and humankind.by focusing on people, kyocera fulfills its wider role in the world. we have always valued the idea of living together and working not only for ourselves but for the world, he says. there are three types of co-existence with society, with the world, and with nature which we have been maintaining since the 1970s. a company cannot continue to exist without co-existing with society and with nature. we have always valued the idea of living together and working not only for ourselves but for the world.

"KPMG - Four Key Consumer Trends, Including Privacy, Have Impacted Purchasing Patterns (Nov-20).pdf","Based on 75k responses gathered over six separate cycles during the pandemic, the KPMG survey points to dramatic shifts in the way the customers see the world around them. First, four key trends (Economic Impact, Erosion of Trust, Rise of Digital and Home is the new Hub) have impacted consumers and ultimately changed their purchasing patterns and consumption. Subsequently, KPMG explores how these trends impact businesses in Banking, Insurance, Retail, and Travel in the short and long term, and suggests how businesses can address these trends to find opportunities.","globally, a different customer has emerged with new behaviors and decision-making criteria. in this responding to consumer trends in the new reality report, our cumulative research is now based on more than 75,000 consumer survey responses taken over 4 months, and we have quantified the scale and nature of these changes. the evidence arising from this research points to a rapid shift in how customers view their world; such is the level of change that it demands an equally rapid response in how firms approach their markets.in this report, kpmg professionals from around the world reflect on how businesses should be responding to the changed consumer. what actions are needed for businesses to survive during the ongoing pandemic? what should organizations prioritize? our research and insights will help leaders to navigate the complexities of the new reality.the consumer reality has changed dramatically over the past few months; firms now need to take advantage of the opportunities and mitigate the risks. this report will enable leaders to navigate the difficult decisions that need to be made.markets covered in the survey france, germany, italy, spain and the uk japan mainland china and hong kong (sar), china. we heard from over 75,000 consumers across 12 markets in six separate waves over 4 months. each wave set out to determine how the evolution of covid-19

months. the trends across the 12 markets are economic impact, erosion of trust, rise of digital and home is the new hub. these themes highlight the pressures consumers are under, their feelings towards brands, and their changing behaviors in the new reality.responding to consumer trends in the new reality .covid-19 is forcing all sectors to reconsider their business models, their capital structure and their routes to market.there are four critical macro trends expected to shape how these considerations need to be made.four consumer trends overview with catastrophe seemingly around the corner, companies rightsizing and optimizing costs are expected to add to economic woes. organizations must quickly understand the economic impact of covid-19 on their customer base, to identify both risks and opportunities.companies should rapidly adopt digital to reduce cost to serve and meet customer demand for e-commerce. they must also manage cyber risk, simplify their product offering and consider how to ensure brand differentiation when face-to-face brand-building opportunities are reduced.The economic impact rise of digital trust in brands is eroding, with reputational risk especially precarious if corporate values do not meet those of customers. companies must promote a sense of purpose, meeting the safety needs of customers and employees first, while also sharing their commitment to environmental and social policies. companies should seek to tap into the growth of the community, the demand for localization and new essentials such as homeware. they need to recognize the changing role of the home as well as flexibility on its location away from urban areas, as working from home becomes mainstream. four consumer trends 2014 so what should organizations focus on now? know your customers think the cost of doing business know your customer and their circumstances. need to understand the financial segments of risk and opportunity.be clear on segment messaging and what is needed to help customers protect themselves against financial uncertainty, risk, and personal safety. determine how customers will interact with you in the future. what is the future role

world. what is it about your brand and social and environmental purpose that means consumers and employees should buy into you and not others? responding to consumer trends in the new reality .the data consumer trends are driven by self-protection covid-19 has affected consumer behavior, from staying at home and avoiding public transport, to prioritizing savings overspending and even moving house. going on holiday, however, looks to be non-negotiable for many.organizations must understand how their customers are feeling and behaving to find specific opportunities in their sector.one in five consumers still want to stay at home.20% want to stay at home as much as possibleas of september, many envisioned a long-term impact on normal life.32%think the impact will be felt for more than a yearnet spend in the next 6201312 months is expected to be down significantly.-21%spend across all categories in the next months vs. pre-covid-19 savings is the number one priority for those with disposable income.36%prioritize savings over other types of expenditure public transport suffers a dramatic loss of confidence vs. pre-covid-19.net confidence vs. pre-covid-19-37% +9%+25%walk/public

covid-19 has been the catalyst for 13% to move home:proportion who have moved home as a result of covid,for my due to for personal working financial safety more from reasons home despite all this, many consumers do not want to give up their holidays, with planned bookings increasing over time.trend #1: economic impact, overview spending is down, savings are up irrespective of how secure consumers feel financially, all predict a decline in spending in the next months. and all are prioritizing savings.the predicted net drop in spending ranges from -35 percent vs. pre-covid-19, for those who are financially overwhelmed, to -8 percent for the financially secure.against this backdrop, all financial segments rate value for money as their key purchase driver.41% of customers feel either financially overwhelmed or financially vulnerable as a consequence of covid-19, a picture which has remained consistent since may 2020.+7% increase in savings as a priority vs. w1; savings is

a -34 percent drop in non-essential purchases.63% consider value for money a key purchase driver, making it the #1 consideration when buying products and services. responding to consumer trends in the new reality. economic impact individual markets polarizing effect and long-term risk while predicted spend is down for all financial segments, covid-19 has had a polarizing effect on financial security: to date, 41 percent of consumers report being worse off, while a small but notable proportion actually feel better off (14 percent).  indeed, for now, nearly half (45 percent) feel financially comfortable, which represents an opportunity for certain sectors. organizations must segment their customers with a view to meeting the increasingly different needs of these groups.  in the longer term, as support from governments ebbs away, it seems inevitable that more consumers will be negatively impacted.trend #2: erosion of trust overview brand trust is lower than pre-covid-19 concerns around personal safety brought trust to a low point in august when compared with pre-covid-19.now marginally recovered at a global level, we can see significant market variation with those locations most adversely affected being france (13 percent), italy (-11 percent) and spain (-9 percent).spain and italy have seen the steepest decline in trust since our first wave of interviews in may/june 2020.fewer people trust brands now than they did pre-covid-19, net trust in brands was positive in june at +3% . trusting brands less than before covid-19 with a slight recovery to -2% in september but fell to -4% in august percentage showing net trust, i.e. trust more than before minus less than before. and to what extent do you trust each type of company now, compared with before the start of the covid-19 situation?trend #2: erosion of trust : individual markets incremental recovery of trust seen in september after a low point in august 2020, nearly all sectors saw consumer trust improve somewhat in september.the insurance sector performs the best at maintaining net trust throughout covid-19.travel, tourism, entertainment and leisure have suffered the most from an erosion of consumer trust, due to the nature of the interactions, the concern around personal safety and the issue of refunds in the travel sector.but here too, tentative recovery was seen in our latest wave of research.china and the uk saw a boost in confidence.both markets saw +5% increase in trust in september.recovery of trust was driven by china, where life is most likely to be getting back to normal, and also the uk, where government incentives such as eat out to help out* drove up consumer confidence over the summer.trend #3: rise of digital . digital is meeting the needs of the new customers with covid-19 reducing in-person interactions, along with a focus on personal safety, digital channels have filled the gap for customers. the use of digital channels has accelerated rapidly, and is set to continue, even once the covid-19 situation has eased. of the 43 percent of customers who previously mainly used in-person channels to contact brands for support, 1 in 3 (33 percent) have now switched to digital channels as their main channel. this is particularly prevalent for non-grocery retail (42 percent have switched to digital) and banking (40 percent have switched).safety aside, the ease of shopping online is the other factor driving increased uptake, especially ease of finding what you want (noted as a key reason for use of digital by 39 percent of customers).use of face-to-face channels to contact brands is down 20% (from 43% pre-covid-19 to 23% now)digital channels have seen a rapid take-up, increasing +18% (from 26% pre-covid-19 to 44% now)45% of customers predict digital channels will be their main way of contacting brands in the future digitally enabled contact channels (i.e. apps, social media, email and messenger apps) have increased in use (+10% overall)followed by website (+6%)responding to consumer trends in the new reality .apps and messenger apps represent the biggest opportunities in the digital space. trend #3: rise of digital . individual markets opportunity for further digital adoption the accelerated adoption of digital channels has varied across markets, with certain markets, e.g. hong kong (sar) china, mainland china, italy and brazil leading the way. these markets see greatly increased use of both new channels for support (including brand/messenger apps and video calling) with many more embracing online delivery services. considering the relative youth of these services in some markets (e.g. italy) prior to covid-19, these illustrate significant shifts in consumer thinking.markets such as germany and france, however, claim less of a shift to digital channel use since covid-19.trend #4: home is the new hub. new habits form as consumers remain at home this situation presents an opportunity for customers to explore a new lifestyle, as the lines between personal and work life are blurred. to date, 37 percent of consumers claim they are working from home more than before covid-19, and a high proportion will continue to do so in the future, especially as restrictions are reinforced. moreover, 13 percent of consumers declare they have moved home as a consequence of this situation. this is more prevalent among those aged between 18 to 44 years old (23 percent).as a consequence, net confidence in walking and cycling is +9 percent vs. pre-covid-19, while confidence in using your own car is +25 percent. on the other hand, consumers trust public transport far less than before (-37 percent). routines have changed, and the road back to normal is long, if indeed it ever happens.only 29% are confident to go back to entertainment and leisure venues. safety concerns are limiting customer confidence to partake in out-of-homeexperiences.+7% increase in customers expecting to prioritize spending one ating at home in september vs. may/june,while spend on out-of-home experiences declines, especially eating out,holidays and leisure.holidays abroad lose relevance as consumers shelter, at least in the short term, closer to home. only 14 percent are planning to book a holiday abroad between october and december 2020.as covid-19 continues, consumers envisage staying at home more20% will stay at home as much as possible 37% claim to be currently working from home more now than before covid-19, with 60 percent planning to do so more in the future evidence of significant changes in working behavior.customers predict they will spend less on non-essentials in future across almost all sectors, with a net spend of -34 percent vs. pre-covid-19. on the other hand, in grocery retail spend is up, despite customers shopping less often.trend #4: home is the new hub. location variationcompanies must respond to regionalization trendthere is a move to relocate, the big winners being suburbs and villages, with consumers looking for a healthier and cheaper way of life. this is an opportunity to explore a new lifestyle away from highly populated city centers, pushing brands to reconsider where their customers are.consumers have adopted new habits, being more focused on in-home experiences and investments, such as purchase of furniture, electronics and gardening. home cooking will likely remain a priority over eating out. companies will need to assess this new opportunity: what are the essentials in the new home hub?convenience, accessibility and safety are key drivers that make local suppliers more appealing to customers. businesses need to reorientate their strategy, supply chain and operations to take into account this de-urbanization.prioritization of spend on in-home experiences continues to grow, while out-of-home consumption is in declinein-homeexperiences2014 eating in (cooking in home, treats, alcohol) 26%, +7% vs. wave 12014 house and garden improvements 21%,

operating models (e.g. industry utilities, managed services, etc.) as well as potential consolidation to drive efficiencies. for customers, banks continue to offer payment holidays to consumers who themselves face financial uncertainty.one in six consumers who own a financial product (18 percent) have applied for a payment holiday in the last 6 months and of these, 16 percent feel they will struggle to pay it back. banks are therefore very concerned about the level of upcoming debt and their potential exposure.they will need to understand the personal circumstances of customers in order to help them navigate the coming months and years. indeed, one in five customers are already asking banks to do more to accommodate them during covid-19.erosion of trustwhile there has been a net loss of trust in banks during the course of the covid-19 situation, trust has not been eroded as deeply as other sectors.indeed, many banks have taken the opportunity to support consumers and engender trust through consumer loans and payment holidays at this difficult time.but do banks have the back-office processes in place to handle such large volumes of loans and to avoid potential fraudulent activity? can they ensure they will treat all customers fairly?there will be a cohort of customers in significant financial distress 2014 what strategies do banks have in place to manage these relationships?long-term reputational risk could arise should either of these factors prove to be a problem.in future however, could covid-19 be the catalyst for open banking? and if so, could the

transactions, banks are having to accelerate their digital investment. larger, established banks have benefited from the 2018flight to safety2019 in these uncertain times with consumers looking for full-service banking both online and on mobile.such banks are in a relatively strong position to develop their own technology, e.g. virtual assistants or ai credit decisioning, or to simply acquire this skillset.we can therefore expect to see consolidation in the sector and also potential competitive pressure from tech firms who have the digital capability and customer base to compete.banks must not only focus on digitization, but also on differentiation. those brands unable to do this are at risk of becoming commoditized 2014 how will they stand out if not through their staff or in-branch?products and services need to be simplified to reduce cost. personalization can be delivered through the point of interaction, making better use of customer data to help predict future

of life around the home is likely to lead to a new focus on regional distribution of branches.convenience for customers will need to be balanced against profitability.city center branches will need to continue to be full service to deal with highly complex processes.while investment in infrastructure is likely to be seen out-of-town, perhaps via pop-up branches or multi-brand outlets for lower margin transactions.traditionally, branches were a source of cross-selling 2014 digital channels will need to quickly rise to the challenge to close this gap.and with consumers sharing more data and increasing online purchasing, bank exposure to cyber threats mounts. cyber security will therefore become an ever increasing focus for this sector.we have seen an increase in third party brokers as

GSMA - The APAC Mobile Economy (Jul-20).pdf,"In APACs less developed markets, the pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of low broadband penetration. Digitization is therefore moving up the agenda for businesses and governments alike, with many accelerated timelines in the wake of Covid-19. However as the pandemic is affecting both supply- and demand-side economics, the number of 5G connections will be ~20% lower in 2020 in APAC than previously expected. Nine markets have launched commercial mobile 5G services, and countries such as Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea aim to be global leaders in 5G. Meanwhile, in countries such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Pakistan, the 5G opportunity is longer term as there is still room for 4G growth.","the mobile industry is stepping up to the covid-19 challenge although there have been many international health crises before, the covid-19 pandemic differs because of its scale and the worldwide efforts being taken to address it. despite the telecoms industry's best efforts to cushion the impact, the outbreak will affect the development of the mobile ecosystem: the pandemic has highlighted the importance of a robust digital economy; in less developed markets, the crisis has exposed the weaknesses of low broadband penetration. digitisation, which was already an important target, is therefore moving up the agenda for businesses and governments alike, with many accelerating their timelines because of covid-19. since 5g is at a crucial early stage and at the cusp of scaling across asia pacific, covid-19 is clearly going to have an impact on deployments and uptake, affecting both supply- and demand-side economics. the impact of covid-19 on 5g growth will be greater in asia pacific since the region is home to some of the first 5g networks, compared to other regions where many markets have yet to launch 5g. as a result, our revised forecasts show that the total number of 5g connections will be almost 20% lower in 2020 in asia pacific than previously expected. more positively, internet connectivity is allowing people to continue working remotely. while working from home has already been an option for office workers for some time, 5g can provide an enhanced experience for virtual meetings and, of course, higher network capacities, making it an important tool to help meet new traffic demands.in the face of these challenges, the digital ecosystem has proved vital in the response to covid-19. participants from the entire digital value chain including operators, vendors, internet players and governments are pulling together to ensure the most positive outcome possible. and as a side effect of the pandemic, mobile operators have been granted a unique opportunity with a boost in the adoption of mature/quality-based services e.g. video calling for business, online collaboration tools, video streaming, e-commerce and mobile payments.the outlook, therefore, is that the impact of covid-19 on the mobile industry will be temporary. it would appear that 5g will experience a short-term dip rather than a long-term slump. however, the economic impact could be longer term, so governments should not raise taxes to offset the economic slowdown, which could jeopardise the recovery of the industry and the digital economy. as the world recovers from this crisis, wider connectivity and better networks will become a priority for consumers, enterprises and governments.5g is growing, but not a priority everywhere. 5g is gathering pace across asia pacific: nine markets have launched commercial mobile 5g services including japan in march 2013 and 12 more have officially announced plans to do so. this makes the region home to some of the most advanced 5g markets in the world, with countries such as australia, china, japan, malaysia, singapore and south korea all aiming to be global leaders in 5g. these markets will see relatively rapid 5g growth, while across developed asia as a whole 5g will account for just under half of total mobile connections by 2025.to support this generational shift and drive consumer engagement in the digital era, mobile operators in asia pacific will invest over $400 billion in their networks between 2020 and 2025, of which $331 billion will be spent on 5g deployments.meanwhile, in countries such as bangladesh, india, indonesia and pakistan, the 5g opportunity is longer term, largely because there is still a lot of room to grow for 4g (which is the dominant mobile technology across asia pacific and will remain so for the foreseeable future). it is unclear whether consumers in many of the region's emerging markets will pay more for a 5g service, particularly when 4g will meet their needs in the majority of cases. the focus for these markets is on getting 4g right and pushing advancements in areas such as identity, digital commerce and payments, and cross-ecosystem collaboration to ensure 5g is launched at the right time under the right conditions to promote a sustainable and competitive 5g mobile industry, which is the foundation for an inclusive digital society.almost 700 million new mobile internet users by 2025 at the end of 2019, 2.8 billion people in asia pacific subscribed to mobile services, accounting for 66% of the population. with nearly 500 million new subscribers added since 2014, the region is one of the fastest growing in the world and home to over half of total global subscribers. while top-line growth is slowing, asia pacific will still account for around half of new subscribers globally by 2025: by this time, we forecast 266 million new subscribers to be connected across the region, bringing the total to just over 3 billion (70% of the population).meanwhile, the connectivity gap is closing. over the next six years, 663 million people across asia pacific will start using mobile internet for the first time, bringing the total number of mobile internet users in the region to around 2.7 billion by 2025 (61% of the population). this growth in connectivity is helping the mobile industry increase its impact across all of the un's sustainable development goals (sdgs) and spurring adoption of mobile-based tools and solutions (e.g. in agriculture, education and healthcare) that aim to improve livelihoods in low- to middle-income countries and close the gender gap.mobile also continues to make a significant contribution to socio economic development across the region. in 2019, mobile technologies and services in asia pacific generated $1.6 trillion of economic value added (5.3% of gdp), with countries increasingly benefiting from improvements in productivity and efficiency brought about by the increased take-up of mobile services. the mobile ecosystem also supported around 18 million jobs (directly and indirectly) and made a substantial contribution to the funding of the public sector, with $180 billion raised through general taxation.policies for digital advancement the current global health crisis has reinforced the need for mobile internet connectivity: it enables citizens to stay informed, educated and entertained; organisations to stay in business; and governments to provide essential services. however, around 240 million people in asia pacific lack mobile internet coverage and a further 1.9 billion people live within the footprint of a mobile broadband network but are not using mobile internet. with the immense impact of the pandemic on economies and societies, there is a greater need for collaborative leadership than ever before.co-operation between the mobile industry and policymakers is vital to ensure long-term digital resilience by improving mobile coverage and making the availability of digital services universal. there are a range of actions that policymakers can take:assign sufficient amounts of mobile spectrum to operators in a timely manner, particularly in the sub-1 ghz coverage bands, which are ideal for affordable rural coverage.avoid inflating spectrum prices, as high auction reserve prices limit network investment by operators and drive up the cost of services.simplify and standardise planning procedures and regulations for site acquisition, colocation and upgrades of base stations and small cells.adopt policies that reduce costs in areas such as taxation, voluntary infrastructure sharing and fees.there has never been a more relevant time for governments to implement policy measures to stimulate demand for internet services and address the barriers to internet use; this can be achieved by improving the affordability of devices and services, increasing digital literacy and skills, and providing locally relevant services. as governments decide on economic support packages that will shape societies for decades to come, digital strategies should be prioritised.23% of total connectionsexcluding licensed cellular iot $180bn mobile ecosystem contribution to public funding(before

and 2025, mobile operators in asia pacific will invest over $400 billion, 80% of which will be on 5g capex . frontline gains mask underlying pains the indian mobile market has been in a period of turbulence over the last few years, which can be traced back to the entrance of reliance jio in 2016. from a consumer perspective, things look good: the price war that followed jio's entry has resulted in india having some of the cheapest mobile data pricing in the world, while the increased availability of affordable handsets from regional vendors has helped push 4g to almost 60% of total connections (compared to 25% and 10% in pakistan and bangladesh respectively).however, the price war has had a significant impact on operator financials: annual revenues have declined by 26% since 2016, while annual ebit has dropped from $2.7 billion to -$0.5 in the same time frame (a swing of over $3 billion). the above factors could weaken the telecoms sector as a whole. future network expansion and 5g plans could be put at risk, and there could be a domino effect on the entire digital value chain. this is particularly pertinent as india looks to enter the 5g era because a thriving mobile sector needs to be in place to help drive the creation and delivery of 5g products and services. the government should therefore seek to create an enabling environment for this to happen, encouraging operators to invest in the market and develop innovative services for the 5g future.while subject to cyclical variation, falling investment levels (total operator capex declined by 22% annually in the second half of 2019) are a further indicator that the market is on an unsustainable path and in need of rebalancing, including an immediate implementation of the national digital communications policy 2018 (ndcp-18), if india is to become a digital powerhouse.while financials are steadily improving, indian operators are under financial stress due to low average revenue per user (arpu), substantial network investments, high spectrum costs and significant debt. this has been exacerbated by the supreme court agr judgment (24 october 2019), which ruled that the leading mobile operators must pay approximately inr 920 billion ($12.09 billion) towards licence fee and spectrum usage charges (plus interest, penalty and interest on penalty). the liability of some of the operators is significant, placing them in a precarious position to repay the huge amounts owed in such a short time is a major, and potentially insurmountable, challenge.key trends shaping digital societies: covid-19 focus the mobile economy asia pacific fearing the impact of covid-19 on healthcare systems and public wellbeing, governments across the globe have instated quarantines, travel bans and lockdowns, among other measures. although there have been many international health crises before, the covid-19 pandemic differs because of its scale and the worldwide efforts being taken to address it. the covid-19 outbreak has had wide-sweeping effects on all aspects of the economy due to falling commodity prices, reductions in international investment, decreased incoming remittances, rising foreign debt burdens and a disproportionate impact on the informal sector (especially important in asia pacific). undoubtedly, the outbreak will affect the development of the mobile ecosystem as well, despite the industry's best efforts to cushion the impact.that said, the digital ecosystem has proved vital in the response to covid-19. participants from the entire digital value chain including operators, vendors, internet players and governments are pulling together to ensure the most positive outcome possible. and as a side effect of the pandemic, mobile operators have been granted a unique opportunity with a boost in the adoption of mature/quality-based services e.g. video calling for business, online collaboration tools, video streaming, e-commerce and mobile payments. at the same time, the situation has brought to attention governments that have not taken the necessary steps to establish an inclusive digital economy.digitisation moves up the agenda for businesses and governments operating across the entire value chain, should take across asia pacific, and indeed around the this as an opportunity to strengthen their role as key world, the covid-19 outbreak has

allocations core 1. transport network upgrades 2. network security upgrades 3. virtualisation investments. initial response to the pandemic as asia pacific and the rest of the world adjust to the new norms of daily life, the importance of connectivity has never been more apparent. operators are keenly focused on ensuring connectivity to keep people connected to their family and friends, work places, and sources of health and emergency information. mobile operators are reaching out to customers and working with governments to provide a range of vital services at this challenging time. they are also exploring how to leverage their big data capabilities to help monitor and limit the spread of covid-19.work is being done in several key areas: maintaining network stability networks will inevitably feel the strain from the surge in online activities, especially because of the large number of people suddenly working from home. operators are investing in added capacity (or reconfiguring capacity profiles as loads move to domestic areas) to ensure their networks remain robust and secure. in some markets, such as new zealand, networks are being given temporary access to additional spectrum.disseminating vital information the ability to keep citizens up to date with the latest advice and prevent the spread of disinformation is of paramount importance in fast-developing situations. as such, operators are working with governments to deliver timely information directly to mobile devices. connecting emergency services in a global health emergency, connecting health centres and hospitals is a top priority, as it enables services such as remote diagnostics and telemedicine. it is expected that regulations may be relaxed in some markets so that operators can ensure the prioritisation of connectivity for emergency services. helping with financial hardship operators are offering a range of solutions to those suddenly facing financial problems: these include flexible payment options, the lifting or extending of data caps to enable increased usage, and free public wi-fi. a number of operators in developing markets have introduced zero rating of mobile money transaction charges and the expansion of transaction and mobile account limits. facilitating remote working in addition to a secure connection, many workers need additional tools and support in order to work from home. operators are providing productivity tools, such as free conference-calling software and training plans, to support home working. and many are providing or enabling access to additional content and services for children at home too, often for free. leveraging the power of mobile big data the use of mobile big data analytics and ai has a key role to play in monitoring and containing disease outbreaks. there are several projects currently underway that involve operators working with national authorities to use aggregated and anonymised movement data to anticipate the spread of covid-19.bangladesh , the government has used big data analytics to create a digital map of covid-19 cases and determine susceptible areas. by responding to an sms sent to them by their

KPMG - Global Manufacturing Will Have Lasting Impact from Pandemic (Nov-20).pdf,"KPMG outlines how companies in the manufacturing sector are becoming more resilient as quickly as possible by adapting to drastic changes in value chains, many of which were unforeseen at the end of 2019. The enterprises that do best in these severely adverse conditions will likely be the ones that are most agile across a wide range of endeavors: new ways of working, accelerated digitalization, stronger supply chain, as well as mergers and acquisitions and divestments of non-core businesses.","in this edition, we discuss how global industrial manufacturers are embracing fundamental societal changes that have occurred in recent months. they are using this window of opportunity to implement transformational plans that have long been aspirational.becoming more resilient in the new reality is now a core competency, with continued success requiring a rapid response to the uncertain and continuously changing business environment. within this survey, results suggest that we must re-imagine our world after the pandemic. the economy  souchet and the workplace will be very different from what they were previously and global sector head, organizations are listening to their customers, suppliers, and workforce as industrial manufacturing they move forward. here are a few key emerging themes: risk reduction and re-balancing of supply chains: global supply chains are already under severe strain in the wake of trade disputes and a shift towards economic nationalism. while the crisis prompts executives to reduce risk by increasing local manufacturing, in some critical industries we feel cost competitiveness continues to be important.technology and innovation: the crisis is accelerating the digitization of business and operating models and businesses need the infrastructure to serve customers, enable employee productivity on-line and protect against new cyber security risks. talent and a new working reality: companies need to consider how to transform their workforce models, as remote working has widened their potential talent pool with the right combination of physical spaces, technology and a flexible workforce. we'll be back with our views around the future of

the responses from ceos in the manufacturing sector as part of the kpmg 2020 ceo outlook survey, a survey of 315 ceos from around the world. the survey was first conducted in january and february 2020 and a follow-up pulse survey was undertaken in july and august 2020. survey respondents were from 11 different sectors, including industrial manufacturing, from the largest economies around the world.

the most serious threat to global public health in a century. it has not only changed (and affected) many lives but has also jolted global manufacturing in ways that are likely to reverberate well into the future. to find out how ceos are responding to the pandemic in eight major economies around the world, kpmg international surveyed more than 300 people in july and august, including chief executives in industrial manufacturing. the main finding is that, at this unique moment in modern history, companies in the sector are striving as quickly as possible to become more resilient, by adapting to drastic changes in value chains, many of which were unforeseen at the end of 2019. agility in the face of extreme adversity often leads to opportunity. ceos are constantly looking for chances to gain a competitive advantage and have stepped up their search for opportunities in the face of industrial disruption more sudden and widespread than any seen in a lifetime. manufacturers are being tested as never before,says souchet, global head of industrial manufacturing at kpmg international. the enterprises that do best in these severely adverse conditions will likely be the ones that are most agile across a wide range of endeavors: new ways of working, accelerated digitalization, stronger supply chain, as well as mergers and acquisitions and divestments of non-core businesses. manufacturing ceos have had to adapt rapidly to deal with the challenges of covid-19. they are protecting their employees, deepening relationships with their vendors and customers, and redefining what success looks like in a changed world. the new reality is very different from the old and is likely to continue changing shape in unforeseen ways well after the pandemic is over. manufacturers are being tested as never before. the enterprises that do best in these severely adverse conditions will likely be the ones that are most agile across a wide range of endeavors 2014  souchet global sector head.flexible supply chains the greatest threat to manufacturers 2019 growth over the next 3 years, apart from the pandemic, is risk to the supply chain, according to chief executives who responded to the survey. this places supply chain resilience front and center in the minds of ceos. when covid-19 first emerged, the focus of concern for global manufacturers was china, which comprises more than a quarter of world output of manufacturers. but after factories there began to reopen in late february, china's exports have surged. western makers of manufactured goods shifted their attention to supply disruptions closer to home, as the pandemic led to widespread factory shutdowns in europe and the us. three of top four threats to manufacturers' growth over the next three years are supply-chain related supply chain operations return to territorial .in response to these changing risks, 66 percent of ceos say they have had to rethink their approach to supply chains. they say they have done so to become more agile while facing pressure from customers and communities to bring production closer to home and to make their supply chains more robust.until recently, some manufacturers may have known little about the location of their suppliers below tier 1. but after covid-19 struck and factories abruptly closed and then reopened, many companies began to consider diversifying their supply sources and relying more on suppliers that are close by. the geopolitical trend toward more territorially-focused government policies is another factor causing manufacturers to reassess where they source their components. but, despite the rise of economic nationalism in the short-term, these trends are unlikely to lead to a long-term buy where you make the approach to the supply chain. companies will continue to look very closely at the cost of inputs, so they will still rely on cost-competitive suppliers, says grant mcdonald, global sector leader, aerospace & defense, at kpmg international. but reduction of risk will likely be important as well, resulting in some rebalancing of the supply chain to create a value framework that also considers supply alternatives and channel simplification.jolted by supply disruptions, tier-1 manufacturers are working hard to get to know their suppliers further down the chain, as they try to identify vulnerabilities. technologies such as blockchain and data analytics are being used increasingly to gain visibility and accountability in the supply chain. also, some big manufacturers may extend credit to ensure their suppliers will survive; others may take a stake in them or buy them outright if they are considered vital. we are likely to see a consolidation among component makers. france, for example, prides itself on having a large collection of homegrown manufacturers in aerospace and transport equipment. this number may shrink in order to strengthen the sector,says  souchet.manufacturers are not just deploying digital technologies to help make their supply chains more flexible. they are also investing in a range of technologies that are part of what has come to be called the fourth industrial revolution. executives say that the pandemic is proving to be a shot in the arm for the digital transformation of their companies. ninety-six percent of manufacturing ceos say that the progress to digitize their operations has accelerated.a message of the survey is that, to remain competitive, many companies that have sped up their digital transformation efforts need to move even faster, and those that have not done so need to catch up quickly or face being left behind, says grant mcdonald. one technology to highlight in this regard is 5g wireless networks, which offer major benefits to manufacturers in terms of data speed, latency, efficiency, reliability, capacity and security. 5g is expected to improve the delivery of mobile broadband services, in comparison with previous wireless technologies, and is expected to support a wide array of new solutions. digital capabilities based on the internet of things, artificial intelligence, autonomous operations, virtual reality and drones are among the solutions that employ 5g networks to deliver big gains in productivity and accelerate innovation. additive manufacturing (also known as 3d printing) is also emerging as a key technology, especially for sectors such as aerospace, particularly in prototypes and low-rate production.impact of the pandemic on manufacturers digital transformation progress has accelerated by a matter of months progress has accelerated by a matter of years progress is the same as before 3%.new ways of working the focus on digitization is clearly reflected in executives strategic choices. almost three quarters (72 percent) of chief executives in manufacturing are prioritizing investment in new technology, approximately three times the number (28 percent) who are prioritizing investment in workforce skills. this picture might exaggerate the disparity in priorities, in part because workers will need to be trained in how to use the new technology. but there is no doubt that executives are concerned about the impact of the pandemic on the workforce. talent risk is seen as one of the most serious threats to the organization's growth in the next 3 years, as noted earlier.remote working makes it hard to address this risk when it comes to attracting talent, which is often in short supply. it is difficult to evaluate job candidates through online videos and to train people remotely. for most manufacturers, there are severe limits to the ability to work from home, because factory workers need to be on the production line and r&d teams need access to equipment and laboratories to develop new products. it is also difficult to instill the company's values. eighty-six percent of ceos in the sector say that remote working has led to significant changes to policies that nurture their company's culture, compared with 75 percent for all industries. this becomes very important when organizations try to keep their best people; loyalty may tend to erode in a remote working environment. strengthening bonds between employees and their employers depends more than ever on corporate leaders sticking by their workers and vice versa.a stronger focus on culture and social issues percentage in agreement remote working has caused big changes in ways to nurture culture manufacturers all industries the pandemic has shifted the focus to social needs manufacturers all industries.shift in values the impact of the pandemic on the lives of employees and customers has led not only to significant changes in companies' styles of working and transacting. it has also shifted chief executives' attitudes toward their companies broader role in the community. many firms are beginning to appreciate that their competitiveness depends on developing stronger links to society, not just on narrow financial indicators. after all, a healthy workforce depends on the resilience of support systems in their communities,says grant mcdonald. if working families are struggling to find childcare or are dealing with school restrictions under covid-19, this will affect their productivity.to demonstrate compassion toward employees, vendors and customers during the pandemic, 79 percent of manufacturers' ceos say their response to the pandemic has caused their focus to shift towards the social component of their environmental, social and governance (esg) program. this compares with 63 percent among chief executives as a whole. an increase in charitable giving is one way to show compassion, but stakeholders are raising their expectations of companies social commitment in areas such as flexible working and racial and gender equality.one way to demonstrate that the shift in values is genuine is to reconsider why the enterprise entered business in the first place. more than three quarters (76 percent) of chief executives say the company's purpose dictated their approach to the pandemic response with their stakeholders. an even higher proportion (86 percent) say they feel a stronger emotional connection to their mission since the health crisis began.the path to the future the shock of the pandemic is causing manufacturers to reassess the risks they face, affecting the management of the workforce, the supply chain, their customer relationships and their operational strategy. big disruptions, such as these, tend to open executives' minds to consider new ways to approach their business. these novel approaches include: a more comprehensive assessment of risk, based on the degree to which threats are interconnected.a more flexible approach to relationships with suppliers and a hybrid method of optimizing workforce productivity, both at home and in the factory.more resilient business models with deeper layers of preparedness for a wider array of threats. investments in people and technology that will enable more agile decision-making to avoid being caught wrong-footed next time there is a major disruption.covid-19 is not the only threat manufacturers face to their market position, says stephane souchet. in fact, it has jolted them into considering the way threats are interconnected and caused them to adopt a broader strategy to enhance competitive advantage. this encompasses the supply chain, operations, finance, and their stakeholders. technology is just one tool, albeit a very important one, to strengthen resilience. by taking a more agile and flexible approach, they will be ready for any future disruptions.the implication is clear. a stronger, better prepared and more resilient organization is likely to thrive, once the pandemic has passed."
KPMG - Industry Perspectives from Telco CEOs (Oct-20).pdf,"The pandemic dramatically increased societys reliance on telecommunication, and telecom providers needed to shift their focus to meet the demand. Details of this shift were captured in KPMGs two-phase survey where Telco CEOs were surveyed in Jan-Feb 2020, before key markets felt full impact of the pandemic. The 2nd survey  repeated in Jul-Aug 2020  captured how their thinking has evolved. The results indicated that telecoms are taking many critical steps to navigate the market disruption, and focusing on business resilience to capture emerging opportunities and new revenue streams that maximize value from 5G capital investments.","telecoms industry ceo outlook accelerating digital transformation: current victories and future challenges. covid-19 stay-at-home orders propelled telecoms providers into the sphere of essential services for most consumers, and heightened the importance of ultra-reliable connectivity for at-home, work, school, and social interaction. demand surged for telecoms services as a huge swath of workers in many sectors shifted from working in an office to working from home overnight, and domestic telecoms networks served as the backbone to keep consumers and many businesses operating through covid-19.to understand the changing environment, and how telecoms providers are adapting to (and investing for) the new reality, the kpmg global ceo outlook study asked leaders how their priorities have changed during this period of unprecedented disruption. the study was conducted in two phases. kpmg initially surveyed ceos in january and february of 2020, before many key markets felt the full impact of the virus. in july and august, kpmg conducted a follow-up survey to understand how ceo thinking evolved over the ensuing months.the results indicated that telecoms provider ceos are taking many strategic steps to navigate the challenges of market disruption, and focusing on the organizational resilience to capture emerging opportunities and new revenue streams. evolving customer needs, network requirements, operating cost structures (e.g., retail stores, call centers) and investment constraints will require telecoms operators to make a series of critical, strategic decisions to help identify and align leadership around the optimal course of action.the events of 2020 have put digital acceleration, societal needs, and talent into even greater focus for telecoms providers.key findings economic outlook standing for equality greatest risks digital transformation esg key takeaways key findings economic outlook telecoms ceos maintained confidence about growth prospects, although at lower levels than we saw at the start of the year. the follow-up survey recorded a notable shift from ceos who were very confident to those that were merely confident, as well as a small number of leaders who reported being not at all confident category that received no responses in the earlier survey. digital transformation the pandemic forced telecoms providers to re-evaluate not only changing consumer demands and usage patterns, but also the best ways to meet their customer service obligations. the result was a sudden shift to a digital-first customer experience and acceleration of digital business models and revenue streams that generate value and enhance resiliency.esg (environmental, social, and governance) covid-19 prompted telecoms providers to accelerate esg initiatives including the use of collaboration tools in reducing business travel and long commutes. as they work to rebuild their companies, telecoms ceos recognize a need to devote more attention to esg issues and to lock in the sustainability and climate change gains made as a result of the crisis.greatest risk factors the pandemic shifted ceo concerns about potential risk factors, with talent and supply chain risks replacing disruptive tech and a return to territorialism as leading threats to organizational growth as indicated earlier in the year:talent risk concerns rose as telecoms ceos cited a challenge with keeping workers connected, engaged, and productive despite surging customer demand, covid-19-related anxiety, and a sudden need to change work patterns. ceos will need to focus on enhancing the employee experience as work-from-anywhere employment strategies increase the ability of top talent to change employers easily. supply chain risk increased as manufacturing shut down suddenly, constraining the global supply of telecoms equipment and popular consumer devices. trade disputes and national security concerns created a highly challenging supply chain environment.cyber security concerns increased in the wake of rising demand and a growing reliance on at-home telecoms services for work, family connections, education, and entertainment needs. providing effective security is an ongoing and expanding opportunity for telecoms companies.emerging and disruptive technology became less of a concern as ceos shifted their focus to meeting surging demand and a near-term need to enhance resiliency.standing for equalityas the pandemic prompted more organizations to demonstrate their role in serving societal needs, telcos were among the companies that made public statements supporting racial and economic equality. telecoms ceos highlighted efforts such as promoting diversity and inclusion in recruitment, promotions, and leadership representation; donations to social organizations; including diversity in performance management; and other measures. 3telecoms industry.key findings economic outlook standing for equality greatest risks digital transformation esg key takeaways as providers shift into what is likely to remain a new reality, they are taking steps to enhance their resilience and evaluating planned discretionary spending, such as marketing investments, to prepare for extended economic downturns. similarly, they are assessing network investments to ensure they are able to meet changes in demand and usage in an always at home environment, and how the changes in usage patterns will affect plans for the 5g buildout and other network upgrades. survey results indicate telecoms ceos maintained confidence in their companies and industry's growth prospects as they demonstrated resiliency throughout covid-19, but at a notably lower level than they reported at the start of 2020.confidence in the global economy, for example, has slipped since the beginning of the year. similarly, there has been a notable shift from very confident to confident in their company's growth prospects. although 69 percent of ceos reported they were confident and 10 percent described themselves as very confident, both of these metrics are lower than in the earlier survey. perhaps more telling, a few respondents selected not at all confident in the follow-up survey, but this response wasn't selected at all in the earlier survey. ceos remain confident, in part, because there's a demonstrated need for existing levels of telecoms services, and many are seeing incremental demand. different countries are recovering at varying rates, but the new normal is likely to mean that reliance on telecoms services will be robust and potentially continue to grow. in this evolving environment, providers will need to make a series of strategic decisions to meet the changed customer needs, cost structures, and network requirements of the new operating reality. economic outlook economic outlook and business confidence, then and now in the initial survey, respondents were asked to indicate their level of confidence over the next 3 years. in the follow-up survey, they were asked to indicate their level of confidence over the next 3 years, compared to the beginning of the year. key findings economic outlook standing for equality greatest risks digital transformation esg key takeaways diversity and inclusion is one of our leadership philosophies and part of our credo as a company, and so talking about it comes very naturally for us.hans vestberg chairman and ceo, verizon communications for verizon communications chairman and ceo hans vestberg, playing a critical role in tackling racial inequality was a logical extension of the company's approach to major societal issues, its strategy, and its leadership philosophy. when i have opinions about societal challenges, it's when it's part of my strategy,he explains. i was always an extremely strong advocate for diversity and inclusion. i've lived and worked in four continents, and i've learned that if you have seven people like me in the room, it's just going to be a disaster. diversity and inclusion is one of our leadership philosophies and part of our credo as a company, and so talking about it comes very naturally for us.vestberg, who was visibly emotional in a video announcement to his staff where he announced verizon was committing us$10 million to organizations that are dedicated to racial equality and social justice, believes that a strong stance is a moral imperative if you find something simply unacceptable. we knew racial injustice was something we needed to talk about because we're not going to accept it, he says. we're really building diversity right here: our customer base is diverse and our company is diverse.among telecoms ceos, when we asked those ceos who had already introduced new diversity and anti-racism measures about what actions they had taken, the top areas were: 1. performance management2. individual training to manage unconscious bias.other areas include:2014 supportive interventions, such as allyship training, that provides foundational information about gender identity and expression, and sexual orientation structural/systemic interventions, such as promoting diversity and inclusion in recruitment, promotion, and leadership representation external interventions, such as donations to social organizations. 1download the kpmg global ceo outlook for additional detail about vestberg's beliefs about standing for equality, or watch this video where he discusses the actions they are taking.standing for equality amidst the many challenges the pandemic caused companies in all industries in 2020, more organizations demonstrated their role in serving societal needs and emphasized corporate purposes that addressed a wider role than serving stakeholders. and as broad-based social movements and a drive for greater equality gained momentum in the united states in the spring and early summer, a growing number of companies made public statements supporting racial and economic equality. threats to an organization's growth over the next three yearskey findings economic outlook standing for equality greatest risks digital transformation esg key takeaways greatest risks the pandemic shifted in the initial survey, respondents were asked to indicate their concerns about threats to their businesses growth. in the follow-up survey, they were asked, aside from the pandemic/health risk, what risks pose ceo concerns about the greatest threats.potential risk factors, 00%in some cases quite talent significantly, with talent 00%and supply chain risks supply chain replacing disruptive tech and a return to territorialism as leading threats to organizational growth as indicated earlier in the year. ceos also cited cyber security challenges as an obstacle to unlocking growth and their ability to capture market opportunities. economic outlook standing for equality greatest risks digital transformation esg key takeaways greatest risks/threats to growth (continued)talent risk one of the factors driving the importance of talent as a leading concern is an interesting corollary to a trend driving industry growth and confidence: telecom-fueled work-from-anywhere employment strategies that increase the ability of top talent to choose and change employers with little regard for geography. this increased flexibility isn't limited to the highest-demand talent or positions, with most back-office workers gaining broader employment opportunities. telecoms ceos also cited a challenge in keeping workers connected, engaged, and productive despite covid-19-related anxiety and a need to change work patterns suddenly. telecoms providers may also need to re-skill their workforces to take advantage of new collaboration tools most effectively. with collaborative work becoming foundational for telecoms companies, leaders will need to ensure their teams are able to leverage new tools and processes to maintain and increase everyday productivity. similarly, telecoms leaders will need to focus on enhancing the employee experience in this new work environment. with the pandemic upending predictable routines for workers in and out of work, ceos will have to adapt to how employees are re-configuring their personal lives to balance work and life.one potential benefit of increased remote work, however, is that providers will be able to access a broader pool of talent that is able to work largely without geographic considerations. despite the heightened importance of talent-related risks, ceos are prioritizing technology investments as they make plans for the next three years, with more than three-quarters indicating they will place more capital investment in buying new technology and digitization than in developing their workforce's skills and capabilities. reskilling workers connected workers broader talent poolwork/life balance supply chain risk we saw a notable shift in ceo attitudes about the importance of supply chain risk. this risk didn't register in the early 2020 survey but rose to a second-leading concern in the follow-up survey. the covid-19-related shutdown of manufacturing constrained the global supply of equipment needed to maintain the 5g rollout and, coupled with rising demand, reduced the availability of popular consumer devices. trade disputes and national security concerns may reduce the availability of 5g infrastructure equipment and competition in the supply chain. similarly, these trade disputes hampered development of semiconductors and chipsets to power upgraded telecoms networks and devices.cyber security the importance of cyber security, and maintaining the security and privacy of customer data, has only increased for telecoms providers. the increased use and growing importance of telecoms services in our work and home lives highlights the importance of providers being able to protect security. more data is being uploaded and accessed in the cloud, more people are working outside of the enterprise networks, more business is conducted over video conferencing, and more students are participating at least part-time in online education all of which are subject to hacking and disruption. telecoms providers recognize that effective cyber security is an obligation, a risk factor, and an opportunity. to the extent consumers are assured about the privacy and confidentiality of their online communications and entertainment, they will be more willing to trust providers and take advantage of telecoms services.standing for equality greatest risks digital transformation esg key takeaways greatest risks/threats to growth (continued)emerging/disruptive technology the importance of emerging technology fell significantly from the top of ceo concerns earlier this year, in part because ceos shifted their strategic focus from future-focused r&d projects to meeting surging demand and ensuring their companies would be able to survive the disruption. the deployment of 5g technology can help telecoms providers solve business challenges, reshape value chains, enhance revenue models, and optimize operations across many industries. the combination of 5g and edge computing can create significant incremental economic value for those in the ecosystem, which is built on four pillars connectivity, software, hardware, and services with key players working together while also competing for their piece of the prize. connectivity is the area of greatest interest to telcos, providing fixed and wireless infrastructure and service on either public or private networks. the value opportunity for telcos is determining how they maximize their position in the ecosystem to capture maximum value, or share of revenue.5g continues to gain prominence in asia pacific and, combined with emerging technologies such as internet of things, will drive convergence in all sectors. interest is rising in nearly every industry to use 5g's capabilities to enable major transformation initiatives. for example, pharmaceutical companies are educating and training medical professionals in remote cities for major surgical operations, while governments are embedding technology into infrastructure assets to enhance smart cities development.and in the u.s., many ceos have accelerated initiatives and collapsed six years worth of digital transformation into six months as much a function of survival as a conscious effort to accelerate transformation. the immediacy of covid-19 bandwidth needs temporarily shifted focus, but as markets, customers, and especially enterprises stabilize their operations, telecoms ceos have a renewed focus on disruptive technology, according to sean sullivan, national telecommunications industry leader, kpmg in the u.s. in addition to 5g, areas such as cloud computing, omnichannel support and sales, and creating a true digital customer experience are top of mind for many ceos. across all industries, clients are telling us about the imperative to accelerate their digital transformation. prior to covid-19, digital had momentum everyone could see the imperative. now the need is greater, perhaps even one of survival. connectivity plays a vital role in any digital transformation, and this has been seen in both fixed and wireless over the last decade. while the 5g business case was strong before, it's even stronger now.standing for equality greatest risks digital transformation esg key takeaways key findings economic outlook telecoms companies are thinking more like technology companies as telecoms providers have shifted their telecoms providers are focused to a greater extent on digital transformation, with 79 percent of them prioritizing investments in service offerings in recent years, many new technology. this is up from 68 percent in our 2019 telecoms have also positioned themselves as ceo outlook survey, and likely

areas of enterprise digital transformation, please say what impact for, and pace of, digital transformation the pandemic has had on progress. the result was a sudden shift to a digital customer experience and the acceleration of digital business models and revenue streams. as these gain momentum, telecoms providers will be challenged to focus their efforts and investments effectively on the areas that generate the most value while similarly enhancing their resiliency. these two questions about the impact of covid-19 on digital acceleration from the july/august survey provide an interesting window into the changing landscape.the creation of a seamless digital customerexperience 45% the creation the digitization of new digital operations and the business models creation of and

66 percent of ceos indicated that the creation of a seamless digital customer experience accelerated by a matter of months, and 24 percent said it accelerated even more sharply putting transformation initiatives years in advance of expectations. however, according to ian west, partner, head of technology, media and telecommunications, kpmg in the u.k., the rising customer preference for digital channels, whether out of convenience or because of covid-19-related restrictions, has also exposed shortcomings. there are organizations coming back to us as clients who thought they were in a good position for digital, that they provided a pretty good digital customer experience. but when the pandemic came along, they found that the experience was one that the customer was merely tolerating.during this disruption, telecoms providers played a critical role in connecting people and businesses. as remote work, education, and entertainment become routine, network capacity issues remain a potential challenge. major wireless providers are likely to continue with planned 5g investments, and fixed-line providers could also accelerate investment to meet rising at-home demand.improving customer experience is also front and center for u.s. telecoms companies, and covid-19 has only served to heighten focus on this critical area. with retail store closures, a portion of purchase and support activity has been forced into online and call centers, which is likely to remain a permanent outcome,201d says sean sullivan, national telecommunications industry leader, kpmg in the u.s. enhancing the call center experience to attract, service, and retain customers is rapidly becoming a major priority in the digital transformation strategy of many telecoms companies.11telecoms industry ceo outlook verizon communications chairman and ceo hans vestberg follows up his statements with actions. he mentioned that early in the pandemic, verizon increased their capital expenditure in their network by almost a us $1 billion dollars, the second week, when the pandemic hit the u.s., we increased our investment in the network, he says. we thought it was the right time. we didn't know how the network will be used. so we wanted to be prepared and we wanted to accelerate the investment in technology at that time, because we're a responsible company, we could invest in that time, and we thought it was good for the country and for our customers.tackling the customer experience means future collaboration will likely be about how to manage online and offline customer support in a seamless hybrid environment, which means digital transformation needs to be top of mind for telecoms providers. cas our clients in asia pacific and globally navigate through the uncertainties of a new reality, they are continually looking to new ways to digitally engage, onboard, and service their customers. the digital agenda has accelerated to take center stage, as we help clients pivot to new business models that will enable them to emerge post-covid, according to darren yong, kpmg asia pacific head of technology, media and telecommunications. this ensures more integrated use cases that deliver value for companies to create more insights and make better decisions around their growth and cost objectives. (environmental, social, and social, and governance)governance)key findings economic outlook standing for equality greatest risks digital transformation esg key takeaways esg in addition to economic challenges, covid-19 promoted telecoms providers to continue and accelerate environmental, social, and governance concerns as they work to rebuild their companies to support a new and sustainable economy. for instance, ceos are looking to continue changes that produced climate-related benefits, such as the role of collaboration tools in reducing business travel and long commutes. telecoms ceos recognize a need to devote more attention to esg issues and taking actions today to impact the medium- and long-term future, with 66 percent agreeing or strongly agreeing they want to lock in the sustainability and climate change gains made as a result of the crisis. similarly, 55 percent agree or strongly agree their response to the pandemic shifted their focus toward the social component of their esg program. climate risk is also on the minds of telco ceos. when asked 201chow likely is it that managing climate-related risks will be a key factor in you keeping your job over the next five years? nearly three-quarters (72 percent) indicated likely or highly likely. 172% of respondents said that addressing climate-related risks will be a key factor to keeping their jobs over the next five years.telecoms has never been a more important industry. during covid-19, society relied on connectivity to access the essential components of our day-to-day life, from communication with friends and family, to maintaining our work life, and educating our children. engineers and other field support are working sometimes in harm's way to keep us all connected. everyone depends on telecoms.economic resilience telecoms companies demonstrated resilience throughout covid-19, but ceos report notable declines in confidence about the global economy and their companies growth prospects. reliance on telecoms services will be robust and potentially continue to grow worldwide, but providers will need to make a series of strategic decisions to meet changed customer needs, cost structures, and network requirements of the new operating reality. standing for equality as broad-based social movements and a drive for greater equality gained momentum in the united states, companies made public statements supporting broad corporate social purposes that include racial and economic equality. some telecom ceos reported a variety of measures to promote diversity and anti-racism initiatives in their organizations, through measures including performance management and individual training to manage unconscious bias.telecoms industry ceo outlook greatest risk factors telecoms ceos are turning their attention to four main risk areas to enhance organizational resilience related to talent, supply chain, cyber security, and emerging technology. supply chain risk has constrained the global availability of 5g infrastructure equipment and popular consumer devices, at the same time that telecoms companies are wrestling with how to capture maximum value and share of revenue from emerging technologies. these companies need to ensure their workforce has the required skills to support emerging technologies and future growth areas. telecoms providers also recognize that effective cyber security is an obligation, a risk factor, and an opportunity. digital transformation covid-19 also accelerated the digital transformation initiatives among telecoms companies, including a sudden shift to a digital customer experience and revenue streams. as these gain momentum, telecoms providers need to focus their efforts on the areas that generate the most value while similarly enhancing their resiliency. network capacity issues still loom, and covid-19 has heightened providers focus on improving customer experience. as telecoms refocus their attention on transformation, they'll also need to adapt their digital business models and revenue streams to maximize value from their capital-intensive 5g investments.esg (environmental, social and governance) covid-19 prompted telecoms providers to accelerate esg initiatives. as they work to rebuild their companies, telco ceos recognize a need to devote more attention to esg issues and to lock in the sustainability and climate change gains made as a result of the crisis."
McKinsey - Climate May Be the Weak Link in Your Supply Chain (Aug-20).pdf,"With the end in sight for pandemic-related supply chain disruption, McKinsey is advocating shifting attention to supply chains exposure to extreme weather events and changing weather patterns.Real-life examples of substantial climate-related disruption are presented. McKinsey discusses negative implications of inevitable climate change and stresses the need to adapt and prepare. While traditional optimization efforts have focused on efficiency, resilience in the supply chain will require equal attention.","climate risk and response: physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts could climate become the weak link in your supply chain? we explored risks today and over the next three decades and examined specific cases to understand the mechanisms through which climate change leads to increased socioeconomic risk. this is one of our case studies, focused on supply chains.we investigated cases that cover a range of sectors and geographies and provide the basis of a micro-to-macro approach that is a characteristic of mckinsey global institute research. to inform our selection of cases, we considered over 30 potential combinations of climate hazards, sectors, and geographies based on a review of the literature and expert interviews on the potential direct impacts of physical climate hazards. we found these hazards affect five different key socioeconomic systems: livability and workability, food systems, physical assets, infrastructure services, and natural capital.we ultimately chose nine cases to reflect these systems and based on their exposure to the extremes of climate change and their proximity today to key physiological, human-made, and ecological thresholds (exhibit 1). as such, these cases represent leading-edge examples of climate change risk. each case is specific to geography and an exposed system, and thus is not representative of an average environment or level of risk across the world. our cases show that the direct risk from climate hazards is determined by the severity of the hazard and its likelihood, the exposure of various stocks of capital (people, physical capital, and natural capital) to these hazards, and the resilience of these stocks to the hazards (for example, the ability of physical assets to withstand flooding). we typically define the climate state today as the average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as the average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050 between 2041 and 2060. through our case studies, we also assess the knock-on effects that could occur, for example to downstream sectors or consumers. we primarily rely on past examples and empirical estimates for this assessment of knock-on effects, which is likely not exhaustive given the complexities associated with socioeconomic systems. through this micro approach, we offer decision makers a methodology by which to assess direct physical climate risk, its characteristics, and its potential knock-on impacts.climate science makes extensive use of scenarios ranging from lower (representative concentration pathway 2.6) to higher (rcp 8.5) co2 concentrations. we have chosen to focus on rcp 8.5, because the higher-emission scenario it portrays enables us to assess physical risk in the absence of further decarbonization. such an inherent risk assessment allows us to understand the magnitude of the challenge and highlight the case for action. (we also choose a sea level rise scenario for one of our cases that is consistent with the rcp 8.5 trajectory). our case studies cover each of the five systems we assess to be directly affected by physical climate risk, across geographies and sectors. while climate changes , case study: supply chains will have an economic impact across many sectors, our cases highlight the impact on construction, agriculture, finance, fishing, tourism, manufacturing, real estate, and a range of infrastructure-based sectors. the cases include the following: 2014 for livability and workability, we look at the risk of exposure to extreme heat and humidity in india and what that could mean for that country's urban population and outdoor-based sectors, as well as at the changing Mediterranean climate and how that could affect sectors such as wine and tourism. for food systems, we focus on the likelihood of a multiple-breadbasket failure affecting wheat, corn, rice, and soy, as well as, specifically in africa, the impact on wheat and coffee production in ethiopia and cotton and corn production in mozambique. for physical assets, we look at the potential impact of storm surge and tidal flooding on florida real estate and the extent to which global supply chains, including for semiconductors and rare earths, could be vulnerable to the changing climate. for infrastructure services, we examine 17 types of infrastructure assets, including the potential impact on coastal cities such as bristol in england and ho chi minh city in vietnam.  finally, for natural capital, we examine the potential impacts of glacial melt and runoff in the hindu kush region of the himalayas; what ocean warming and acidification could mean for global fishing and the people whose livelihoods depend on it; as well as potential disturbance to forests, which cover nearly one-third of the world's land and are key to the way of life for 2.4 billion people.6mckinsey global institute .we have selected nine case studies of leading-edge climate change impacts across all major geographies, sectors, and affected systems.drought risk defined based on time in drought according to palmer drought severity index (pdsi). will india get too hot to work?a Mediterranean basin without a Mediterranean climate?will the world's breadbaskets become less reliable? how will african farmers adjust to changing patterns of precipitation?will mortgages and markets stay afloat in florida?could climate become the weak link in your supply chain?can coastal cities turn the tide on rising flood risk?will infrastructure bend or break under climate stress?reduced dividends on natural capital?infrastructure services natural capital .climate risk and response | case study: supply chains dark, stormy skies, ships and the port of colon, panama. could climate become the weak link in your supply chain? much of global economic production is organized around a complex system of interdependent supply chains. supply chains facilitate the production of everything from computers and cars to lifesaving medicines and food, and support world trade in goods that is worth almost $20 trillion annually.end products may have up to many thousands of parts, sourced from diverse geographies around the world. over time, these supply chains have been honed to deliver maximum efficiency and speed. but questions about supply chain risks and resilience are now being raised in the context of the global covid-19 pandemic as well as acute weather events.a changing climate and the greater frequency and/or severity of hazards may increase disruptions in supply chains that interrupt production, raise costs, hurt corporate revenues, and lead to higher prices or shortages for consumers. according to a recent allianz survey of companies, business interruptions are the number-one risk facing the corporate sector today.a similar poll by the world economic forum found natural catastrophes as the greatest concern for businesses in east asia and the pacific.hurricanes and floods contribute to the majority of economic losses in natural disasters, accounting for 50 percent and 20 percent of total losses since 2000, respectively.5 in this case study, we examine how risks from climate hazards, already present in global supply chains, are likely to evolve over the next few decades. we focus specifically on the risk from hurricanes and extreme precipitation and find that supply chains can be disrupted in different ways. for example, access to plants or production at plants can be shut down or production of critical inputs or access to them can be disrupted, impacting production downstream and potentially increasing prices to manufacturers and consumers. we identify three broad types of supply chains that illustrate how climate risks vary across a spectrum: specialty, intermediate, and commodity. typically, the more specialized the supply chain, the more severe the impact for a downstream player could be as supply of a critical input may only be available from the source that has been disrupted. however, the more commoditized the supply chain is, the larger the number of downstream players that may be affected by spiking prices from a sudden reduction in supply. for a deeper appreciation of the extent of risks, we focus on two supply chains that illustrate how disruption may play out. as an example of specialty supply chains, we examine the semiconductor industry; for commodity supply chains, heavy rare earth metals. both create critical inputs for advanced industries. semiconductor chips are ubiquitous in electronics from computers to smartphones to electronic watches. rare earths are critical in aerospace and defense, electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, medical appliances, and other electronics. both supply chains are highly geographically concentrated in regions with an increasing probability of relevant climate hazards. however, these are only examples illustrating broader trends. 1 world trade statistical review, 2018. see also globalization in transition: the future of trade and global value chains, mckinsey global institute, january 2019.recent mgi research examines how industry value chains are exposed to a broader set of risks, including climate events. this work also examines vulnerabilities within specific companies and broader value chains, financial losses, and ways to bolster resilience. see risk, resilience, and rebalancing in global value chains, mckinsey global institute, august 2020. world economic forum, regional risks for doing business 2019, world trade organization, 2019.how drought can affect supply chains drought has already impacted supply chains across the world. in europe, for example, drought has had a significant impact on the flow of goods through waterways. in the third quarter of 2018, transport on the rhine was down 27 percent year on year due to low water levels. transport performance was also 10 percent lower on the danube.1 this resulted in a 10 percent drop in germany's production of chemicals and pharmaceuticals from september to november, as major industrial players shut down plants that were unable to secure raw material, reporting in some instances over $220 million in additional logistics costs. the panama canal, which shortens the 8,000-mile journey around cape horn to just 48 miles, is already having to reduce weight on ships due to reduced water levels in drought conditions.2 similarly, along the mississippi river in the united states, both floods and droughts have disrupted logistics and agricultural production over the past decade.3 a tow on the upper mississippi river typically has 15 barges, each capable of carrying more than 1,000 tons. a one-inch drop in river level can reduce tow capacity by 255 tons.a major river in europe hit by drought could create economic havoc,cnbc, july 31, 2019. climate change threatens the panama canal,201d economist, september 21, 2019. henry fountain, what panama's worst drought means for its canal's future, new york times, may 17, 2019. karl plume, floods stall fertilizer shipments in latest blow to u.s. farmers, reuters, april 25, 2019;

US energy sector vulnerabilities to climate change and extreme weather, us department of energy, 2013.extreme events that exceed the design threshold of physical assets can cause major supply chain disruptions. one of the costliest floods in the past decade occurred in thailand in 2011. flood defenses that were supposed to keep industrial facilities dry broke and became overwhelmed by extreme rain, disrupting production of food, automobiles, and consumer electronics and raising prices for consumers (what happened in thailand in 2011 when the floods hit?). design thresholds vary but are typically defined to be tolerant up to a specific magnitude of event, which in turn has a specific frequency or likelihood associated with it (often referred to as the historical return period of the event). common design thresholds for manufacturing assets are typically in the range of 1 to 2 percent probability events (also known as 100-year201d and 50-year events, respectively), depending on what is required either by local regulations or by reinsurers.as climate change makes extreme weather more frequent and/or severe, it increases the annual probability of events that are more intense than manufacturing assets are constructed to withstand and supply chain disruptions become more common. research suggests that thunderstorm conditions will become more frequent due to climate change, and furthermore that hurricane rainfall, average intensity, and proportion of storms that reach category 4 or 5 will increase, magnifying disruption risk for manufacturing in asia and along the us gulf coast. what happened in thailand in 2011 when the floods hit?in 2011, thailand suffered the worst flooding in 50 years with many regions under 3 meters of water at peak severity, inundating entire provinces in the industrial areas near bangkok.1 flooding lasted 30 to 60 days, disrupted global electronics, automotive and food supply chains, and resulted in losses totaling $40 billion to $50 billion.2 the impact on local industry was severe; industrial output in thailand dropped almost 50 percent in november 2011 compared with the previous year. manufacturing accounted for 70 percent of damages and losses, representing about one- third of manufacturing value added in thailand at the time.while climate attribution studies broadly suggest no link of the thai floods to climate change, they are a good illustrative example of how increasing frequency of extreme events can threaten specific supply chains.there were several factors that made the impact from these floods so severe: 2014 production was concentrated"

proposal set specific 2030 and 2050 emission-reduction goals, it did not explain how much each sector and member state should contribute to the desired emissions reductions or what achieving those reductions would cost. much work remains to chart the european union's course toward a climate-neutral future in which prosperity would also increase for every socioeconomic group.to help inform the planning efforts of policy makers and business leaders and explore the implications of the required changes, mckinsey has attempted to find a societally cost-optimal pathway to achieving the emissions targets established by the european green deal plan.the european commission has embraced its responsibility to help slow and halt global warming. mckinsey recognizes the importance and the urgency of the task that europe has set for itself. in keeping with our history of exploring environmental-sustainability issues, we offer this report not to prescribe what europe's policy makers should do but to provide a factual basis for comparing emissions-reduction approaches. further, we hope the report will help leaders in the public and private sectors launch emissions-reduction projects that will secure a healthy, prosperous future for europeans.we defined more than 600 emissions-reduction initiatives covering 75 economic sectors and ten geographic regions. then we selected initiatives and combined them to form different decarbonization pathways, any of which would enable the european union to achieve its targets for 2030 and 2050. countless possible pathways exist, covering a wide range of costs and economic impacts. this report describes the least costly pathway among the many we identified.this cost-optimal pathway, we believe, illustrates the technical feasibility of achieving the european union's emissions-reductions targets. it also shows that decarbonizing europe can have broad economic benefits, including gdp growth, cost-of-living reductions, and job creation. the effort involved in delivering these benefits would be just as broad, requiring a continent-wide effort to make significant changes to every sector of europe's economy. magnus tyremaneurope managing partner tomas naucl00e9rsustainability practice leader, europehauke engelpartner1 we define the societally cost-optimal pathway as the most cost-efficient way that society as a whole can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.what would it take for the european union to reach its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by 2050? this report is our attempt to answer that question. it presents the results of a comprehensive research effort on a cost-effective, feasible pathway to a net-zero europe. our analysis identified the optimal uses of more than 600 emissions-reduction levers in 75 subsectors and ten regions and assessed their impact on employment and other socioeconomic factors. the outcome is not a forecast, but a scenario that departs profoundly from current trends. it is a macro view; future research will examine challenges and opportunities at the company level. here are the key findings.europe can reach net-zero emissions at net-zero cost. reducing ghg emissions would raise the cost of doing business in some sectors; savings in others would make up the difference. if these costs and savings were passed along to consumers, the average cost of living would decline slightly for low- and middle-income households.the transition would yield a net gain of 5 million jobs. reaching net-zero emissions would create 11 million jobs and eliminate 6 million jobs through 2050. up to 18 million people could need training and transition support. sectors would need to reduce emissions in parallel and reach net-zero in sequence. the power sector would reach net-zero emissions first, in the mid-2040s, because most of the necessary technology is available now. transport would approach its target in 2045, followed by buildings in the late 2040s, industry in 2050, and then agriculture.more than half the emissions reductions could be achieved with mature and early-adoption technologies.about 25 percent of emissions reductions would come from pilot-stage technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, and 15 percent from technologies now in the r&d phase. accelerating the development and deployment of zero-carbon technologies will be critical.energy systems and land use would need to be reconfigured. by 2050, consumption of oil, gas, and coal would decline by more than 90 percent; power demand would double; and renewable sources would generate more than 90 percent of electricity, up from 35 percent now. some 30 mha of marginal lands would be used to produce biomass.net-zero europe decarbonizing europe will cost less if the burden is shared effectively. regions where mitigation is especially economical could pursue faster reductions, thereby reducing the overall cost. for example, the nordics, which have large natural carbon sinks, could help offset residual ghg emissions elsewhere.nearly 20ac1 trillion must be invested per year; cost savings would offset increased capital spending. an average of 800 billion per year in capital spending roughly a quarter of all eu capital outlays would need to shift from carbon-intensive technologies to low-carbon technologies. an additional 180 billion would need to be invested each year. that sum would be offset by savings in operating expenses.policy interventions would be required to stimulate investment. just half of the investments needed for a net-zero pathway would turn a profit. government financing of around 4.9 trillion could close the gap. alternatively, a carbon price of 50/co2 would make three-quarters of the necessary investments profitable, and a carbon price of 100/co2 would make 85 percent profitable.energy security and competitiveness could increase. europe would become effectively energy independent, but could become more dependent on imports of climate-neutral technology components or materials. at the same time, the eu has a major opportunity to accelerate r&d, retain leadership, and penetrate new export segments. all stakeholders must take action now. near-term actions include scaling up existing technologies and businesses to reduce ghg emissions over the next decade, accelerating innovation and investment to enable reductions after 2030, and investing in research and development of technologies that will complete the transition to climate neutrality by 2050. 11net-zero europe executive summarythe eu could achieve net-to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the zero emissions at net-zero costeuropean union has a long road ahead2 (exhibit 1). in 2017, the eu-27 countries in december 2019, the european emitted 3.9 gt co2e, including 0.3 gt co2e commission announced the eu green of negative emissions.although this deal, one of the world's most ambitious accounts for only 7 percent of global plans to tackle climate change. if greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, the approved by the european union's eu achieving climate neutrality would 27 member states, the bloc would have a big impact on the global climate commit to reaching net-zero emissions by challenge. its success could serve as a 2050, with an interim target of reducing blueprint for other regions, encourage emissions by 55 percent compared to other countries to take bolder action, and 1990 levels by 2030.kickstart the virtuous cycle of increasing adoption and cost reduction of low-carbon technologies. five sectors emit the bulk of the european union's greenhouse gases: 28 percent comes from transportation, 26 percent from industry, 23 percent from power, 13 percent from buildings, and 12 percent from agriculture (exhibit 2). across sectors, the biggest source of ghgs, accounting for 80 percent of emissions, is fossil fuel combustion. not all of these emissions will need to be reduced to zero because negative emissions in some sectors can offset the hardest-to-abate emissions in others. yet achieving the targets will require significant changes in all sectors. in this report, we use emissions reduction to refer specifically to ghg emissions reduction and may also use these terms interchangeably with 201cdecarbonization.net zero or net-zero emissions refers to net-zero ghg emissions. emissions data from 2017 was latest available at time of analysis. we use co2 throughout the report. for further explanation on co2 conversions, see the technical appendix.land use, land use change and forestry entails all forms in which atmospheric co2 can be captured or released as carbon in vegetation and soils in terrestrial ecosystems .europe the challenges in reducing emissions vary by country. some regions such as benelux are home to much heavy industry and serve as hubs for air freight and shipping subsectors that are harder to decarbonize. in other countries such as spain and ireland, ghg emissions have grown since 1990 because of economic growth, putting them farther behind most other eu countries. aside from these factors, the pervasiveness of a country's use of coal-based power generation and the availability of natural carbon sinks would significantly impact how easy it is for each country to decarbonize. we find that the european union could achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 at a net-zero cost. the investments and cost savings would be higher in some sectors and countries than others. however, if the cost increases and savings of decarbonization were passed through to households, the aggregate cost of living for an average household in a climate-neutral european union nation would be roughly the same as it is today. middle- and lower-income households would see some savings, while high-income households may experience a small cost increase. and the value of the stranded assets resulting from the transition would total 20ac215 billion.4 in the following sections, we break down the cost-optimal pathway by sector, region, technology, and energy and land-use system.4 we calculate the stranded value of prematurely retired assets by multiplying the share of remaining useful life at the point of retirement with the initial capital investment. for example, retiring an asset after 30 years that cost 50 million to build and would have a useful life of 50 years produces a stranded asset value of  50 million x (20 years/50 years) = 20 million.net-zero europe our methodology, and what this report is and is notthere are many paths to achieving eu climate neutrality by 2050. in this report, we outline and explore one particular pathway that is feasible from a technology and supply chain perspective and cost-optimal in aggregate, based on current outlooks. to arrive at this pathway, we applied more than 600 decarbonization lever business cases across 75 subsectors in 10 regions to minimize the overall cost to the european union of achieving the 2030 and 2050 targets. in this optimization, we accounted for many eu-wide and regional constraints such as the amount of sustainably available biomass, supply chain constraints limiting the ramp-up rates of electric vehicle (ev) production, and the total available land for generating renewable power. we did not constrain economic growth nor consumption, and we assumed that production locations will not shift. we also did not account for the value of the non-monetary benefits from reducing emissions, such as reduced air pollution and associated health benefits or reduced physical climate risks. the result is a pathway that outlines how member states could work together across sectors to reduce the european union's overall emissions by 55 percent (compared to 1990) by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050. for more details on our methodology and assumptions see the technical appendix, section 6, and for a view on the uncertainties in our modeling, refer to pathway ambiguities, section 2.4.this is not a forecast. achieving the european union's climate goals would require a substantial departure from the current trajectory. since the impacts of the transition would be unevenly distributed and create challenges for many individual companies and actors, significant changes to policies and regulations would be required. and while we lay out a pathway optimized for net costs, other factors would impact the decarbonization pathway the european union ultimately takes. nonetheless, we believe investigating this pathway is valuable for two reasons; first, it provides a helpful roadmap based on current best understanding, and second, it is a valuable tool to explore the magnitude of the challenge and the resulting socioeconomic implications.it also is primarily a macro view. our scenario minimizes net system costs using a societal discount rate. it is important to bear in mind that the perspective of individual stakeholders and the decisions they would take in the absence of changes in regulation and incentive structures may differ, both because there are disparate impacts on individual stakeholders and because they may apply different costs of capital and payback expectations in investment decisions; for an investigation of the latter point and how capital could be mobilized, refer to bridging the finance gap, section 4.1.3. while we explore macro-level socio economic implications such as employment displacements, impacts on household costs, structural cost changes on the sector-level, and risks and opportunities for trade and production, we do not investigate the specific challenges that the zero-emissions transition creates for individual companies. these can be significant. and while we explore some of the potential actions that business leaders and policy makers can take to navigate and shape the transition in section 5.2, detailed perspectives on how players in each sector can navigate and thrive in the transition are not within our scope. these sector-specific company-level 201cmicro201d views will be the subject of future publications.17net-zero europe sector perspective: interdependencies and supply chain scale-ups although achieving net-zero emissions will require sustained effort across sectors, some could meet the target more quickly than others (exhibit 3). in our pathway, the sectors would reach their emission-reduction goals in the following order: 1. power: with wind and solar power generation technologies already available at scale, power would be the quickest sector to decarbonize, reaching net-zero emissions by the mid- 2040s. since the demand for power will double as other sectors switch to electricity and green hydrogen, the sector must rapidly scale renewable production and expand its storage capacity. 2. transportation: this sector would approach climate neutrality by 2045. evs are already in early adoption, but it will take the better part of 10 years to set up supply chains to support a switch to 100 percent ev sales, from mining the raw materials for batteries to assembling evs. once this happens, emission reductions can happen quickly, except for those from aircraft and ships that are too big and travel too far to rely on batteries or fuel cells. they must opt for the more expensive solution of switching to biofuels, ammonia, or synfuels. 3. buildings: most of the technology required to decarbonize the buildings sector is already available. however, renovating large portions of the european union's buildings stock is a massive undertaking. the percent of dwellings using renewable heating sources would need to increase to 100 percent from just 35 percent today. gas usage in buildings would also need to drop by more than half. the buildings sector would reach net-zero in the late 2040s. 4. industry: the industrial sector would be close to climate-neutral only by 2050. the most expensive sector to decarbonize, industry would require new technologies that are still under development. already in the next decade, about 40 percent of emissions will have to be reduced. an accelerated maturation of hydrogen based steel making would kickstart the low-carbon hydrogen industry. even when applying beccs on some industrial sites towards 2050, the sector would continue to generate residual emissions from activities such as waste management and heavy manufacturing, which would have to be offset by negative emissions in other sectors or natural carbon sinks. 5. agriculture: using more efficient farming practices, such as managing manure, switching farm equipment to alternative fuels, and using enhanced efficiency fertilizers, could reduce some agricultural emissions, but it's by far the hardest sector to abate without changes in consumption. the transition of this sector might strain its competitiveness and will require aligning regulatory frameworks, changing farming practices, and adopting consumption changes at large scale. the latter is because more than half of agriculture emissions come from raising animals for food, which can2019t be reduced without significant changes in meat consumption or technology breakthroughs, such as vaccines or next-generation feed additives that inhibit enteric fermentation. because we didn't factor in dietary shifts, our cost-optimal pathway for this sector requires offsetting agriculture emissions with land-use changes that would create more carbon sinks and drawing on negative emissions generated by other sectors. stronger together, on individual pathways four geographical factors will determine how easy it is for each country to reduce emissions and which decarbonization measures would be the most cost-optimal. those are local climate, co2 storage opportunities, local agriculture practices, and the amount of land available for reforestation and construction of wind farms and solar plants. for example, the northern eu countries would benefit from the shallow waters and more hours of wind in the north sea, including 30 to 60 percent more hours of onshore wind than in the south. the north also has the majority of possible carbon storage sites, most of which already have oil and gas pipelines. southern countries would benefit from the 1,000 more hours of sunlight they receive per year. because of these differences, a cost-optimal pathway would see eu member states achieve climate goals collectively rather than individually, so they can pool their relative advantages and lower transition costs (exhibit 4). for example, cross-border collaboration would allow countries with recent emissions growth to catch up without resorting to expensive near-term reduction measures. countries with more abundant solar resources or natural carbon sinks could also help other countries reduce or offset their emissions at a lower cost than through measures such as capturing and storing co2 from residual emissions locally. in a scenario in which the european union's climate goals were achieved at the individual member-state level instead of in aggregate, the cost of the transition would increase by roughly 25 per co2e. technology perspective: most of the required technologies are available, but accelerated innovation will be critical through 2030, some 64 percent of the european union's emissions reduction would be achieved by large-scale electrification and increases in energy efficiency, accounting for 47 percent and 17 percent, respectively. demand-side measures and circularity would reduce emissions an additional 15 percent. hydrogen would contribute another 13 percent. the remainder would come from ramping up the use of biomass, land-use changes, and other innovations such as inert anodes in aluminum production (exhibit 5). the rest would come from ramping up the use of hydrogen and biomass, land-use changes, and other innovations such as inert anodes in aluminum production (exhibit 5).on the cost-optimal pathway, some countries2019 emissions reductions would compensate for others2019.over emissions target under emissions target net-zero europe toward 2040, electrification opportunities would approach their maximum uptake, and other measures would become the focus. by 2050, 45 percent of the european union's total emissions would be abated by switching from fossil fuels to electrification, and another 30 percent would be eliminated by using hydrogen, biomass, and ccs. 21exhibit5through 2030, nearly two-thirds of emissions reduction could be achieved with energy efficiency and electrification.of the total of the emissions reduced by bioenergy carbon capture and storage (beccs), half are attributed to biomass and the other half to ccsnet-zero europe 22net-zero europe energy system and land-use perspective: reconfiguring the energy system and rethinking land use energy system reconfigured: today, the european union meets 75 percent of its primary energy demand with fossil fuels. on the pathway we outline, fossil fuel use would decline significantly over the next three decades. most coal consumption would be eliminated by 2030, and oil and gas consumption would drop to less than 10 percent by 2050. renewable power would satisfy more than 80 percent of primary energy demand by 2050, with most of the rest from bio"

global plunge in ev sales.mckinsey's recent analysis of global electric-vehicle markets shows both challenges and opportunities ahead.mckinsey's proprietary electric vehicle index (evi) assesses the dynamics of the e-mobility market in 15 key countries worldwide (for more information on the metrics evaluated, see sidebar what is the electric vehicle index?). evi results for 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 provide important insights about market growth, regional demand patterns, market share for major electric-vehicle (ev) manufacturers, and supply-chain trends.growth in the

europe cushions a global plunge in ev sales what is the electric vehicle index? mckinsey's proprietary electric vehicle index (evi) focuses on battery electric vehicles (bevs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (phevs). since we created the evi, several years ago, it has given organizations in the automotive, mobility, and energy sectors a detailed view of the electricvehicle (ev) market, while highlighting potential future trends.the evi explores two important dimensions of electric mobility: market demand analyzes the share of evs in the overall market, as well as factors affecting ev penetration in each country, such as incentives (for instance, subsidies), existing infrastructure, and the range of available evs.industry supply explores the share of a country's oems in the production of evs and ev components, such as e-motors and batteries, looking at both current and projected numbers.the evi assesses the key performance indicators in each country and rates them on a

reflect the decline of the overall light-vehicle market, which fell by 5 percent in 2019 and by an additional 29 percent in first-quarter 2020. despite the overall drop in sales, global ev market penetration increased by 0.3 percentage points from 2018 to 2019, for a total share of 2.5 percent. with additional growth in the first quarter of 2020, ev penetration is now at 2.8 percent.to gain different perspectives on the ev industry's growth and other topics, we interviewed various mckinsey experts (see sidebar, expert views on the electric-vehicle sector's future development). the remainder of this section explores regional market variations.expert views on the electric-vehicle sector's future development how will the global electric-vehicle (ev) market develop over the short to mid term? many uncertainties persist, so we asked some mckinsey experts about their views on pressing issues.china's declining ev sales, resulting from the government's subsidy cuts, raise concerns about the sustainability of customer demand in the country. how will sales develop, especially considering the covid-19 crisis, and what is the government's strategy to achieve its 25 percent sales target for new-energy vehicles (nevs) by 2025?ting wu (partner, shenzhen): nevs are still a top priority for the chinese government and take center stage in its post-coronavirus stimulus plan. the government recently decided to extend nev subsidies by two years, to the end of 2022. in addition, rmb 10 billion ($1.4 billion) will be invested to expand the charging network for electric vehicles (evs) this year. overall, increased government purchases will probably drive the market. nevertheless, achieving the 25 percent target by 2025 will be a challenge and probably require additional policy instruments and new business models to spur sufficient consumer demand. automakers are relying on evs to achieve europe's upcoming carbon-dioxide emissions limits for 2020 and 2021. although we have seen strong dynamics across countries, will the industry sell enough evs to avoid looming penalty payments, and what might be the impact of the covid-19 crisis?patrick schaufuss (associate partner, munich): oems have invested more than 20ac30 billion in evs over the past two years to meet europe's upcoming carbondioxide regulations. oems plan to make a spot landing on the targets. every gram these companies miss costs the industry about 20ac1.5 billion, but overachieving would tighten their 2030 targets. in the first quarter of 2020, we saw increased momentum on the consumer side for buying evs, despite the covid-19 pandemic. other signs also suggest that the momentum of evs will be sustained in europe for instance, the creation of ad-ditional purchase incentives, the timely creation of ev standard operating procedures, and an infrastructure rollout.given the recent loosening of the us federal emissions regulations, how will the trajectory of the us market and the ev strategies of traditional automakers evolve over the coming years? russel hensley (partner, detroit): vehicle electrification strategies will remain rela-tively consistent, despite the uncertainty about current regulations and the ensuing debate between federal and state policy makers. while some automakers may have cut or delayed their ev programs, domestic oems must continue their efforts to enhance the average fuel economy of their new fleets, given the large share of light trucks, suvs, and compact utility vehicles.many automakers use plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (phevs) as a bridge to a fully electric future. how will this technology develop? ruth heuss (senior partner, berlin): over the past few years, sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles have been growing more slowly than sales of pure battery electric vehicles (bevs). phevs represented less than a third of the global ev market in 2019. while most automakers offer them, the number of available models will remain less than half of the number of bev models over the coming years. although a higher driving range is one of the major advantages of phevs, the electric range of bevs has mckinsey electric vehicle index: europe cushions a global plunge in ev salesbeen constantly increasing: it rose by 55 percent from 2017 to 2020 and is now around 400 km. given typical driving behavior, phevs recently started to face regulatory headwinds as their environmental impact raised concerns. in reaction, some countries have reduced or entirely abolished monetary subsidies for phevs, further increasing their already higher price point for consumers. in 2019, among the key ev markets, phevs dominated ev sales in only three countries: finland, ice-land, and sweden. we therefore currently forecast that phevs will represent only 5 to 10 percent of the global market by 2030. that could fall even further as emissions regulations are increasingly based on real consumption.we hear very little about hydrogen fuel-cell evs, except for a few models from japanese and south korean manufacturers. will the technology contribute to green mobility in the future, and if so, will it emerge first in the passenger or light commercial-vehicle segment? anna orthofer (associate partner, vienna): there is actually quite some noise around hydrogen on the commercial  vehicle front. most large oems have teamed up to work on the technology for example, daimler and volvo, toyota and traton, and honda and isuzu. new players, such as nikola and hyzon, are entering the market, and chinese companies are moving fast. the big suppliers are following by building a comprehensive system offering in fuel cells. overall, we see fewer and fewer oems that do not think about hydrogen as a necessary part of their powertrain portfolios. in light of carbon-dioxide regulation for trucks (such as the european union's 30 percent by 2030 target), each ton in weight and each kilometer in range will improve total costs of ownership for fuel cells relative to batteries. for long-haul trucks, our models show that fuel-cell electric vehicles can break even with battery electric vehicles within the next five years. they will also achieve lower total costs of ownership than diesel before 2030. markets such as china, sweden, and the united kingdom have reacted strongly to ev-incentive changes. yet customer demand independent of government subsidies remains a major concern in the industry. who is currently buying evs, and what is required to scale up the market?timo miller (partner, cologne): early adopters of bevs appear to constitute a specific segment of consumers, best described as tech-savvy urban people with above-average incomes and a familiarity with online shopping. beyond first movers, consideration of evs has significantly increased among consumers over the past few years as they have come to recognize the numerous benefits of evs. to scale up the market, oems should thus systematically try to affirm the consumers' growing positive attitudes about many aspects of evs, such as the driving experience and subsidies. oems should also disprove consumer fears, such as range anxiety, that do not reflect reality and solve pressing pragmatic problems, such as the availability of charging stations.shifting portfolios from internal combustion engines (ices) to evs is a major challenge for traditional automakers, especially considering profitability. what is the current view of profits for evs sold today? will falling costs and rising con-sumer demand overcome the need for government support, and how can oems share the pain? patrick hertzke (partner, london): shifting the vehicle portfolio from ice to phev/bev2014a change driven by regulation and shifting consumer demand is now a paramount focus for traditional automakers. many of them are concerned about profitability. the majority of ev models are still unprofitable, but this is changing. at-scale ev producers will have a clear cost advantage in the near term, while other oems are more likely to seek partnerships to co-develop ev platforms or even fully merge. ev growth across transport sectors also remains one of the most critical levers in global efforts to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and improve urban air quality. ev supply chains will get even greener over time with the expansion of renewables and the recycling and reuse of batteries. covid-19 and the related economic crisis will raise the stakes further as the world seeks cleaner transport solutions but could require governments to continue their subsidies and penalties as well. they may also need to add other measures, such as green early-scrappage programs, which encourage consumers to swap older cars for evs.inspired by the ambitious ev strategies of automakers, battery-cell suppliers are ramping up their capacities. what are the key trends and challenges for the battery supply chain?markus wilthaner (associate partner, vienna): the uptake of evs has super-charged industrialization and expansion in the industry. battery cell makers have an outsize growth opportunity in front of them. by revenue, they could become some of the largest automotive suppliers globally. this opportunity comes with huge challenges and trade-offs. they need to ramp up production capacities fast, while remaining disciplined about capital expenditures. battery-cell makers must also stabilize production processes and achieve very high yields, while constantly pursuing product innovations. every mckinsey electric vehicle index: europe cushions a global plunge in ev salesyear, they must reduce costs to deliver on long-term contracts and remain competitive, while simultaneously seeking new business models and opportunities for differentiation. finally these suppliers must solve challenges related to sustainability by turning the whole battery value chain, from mining to recycling, into a sustainable and responsible industry.demand for battery cells is expected to increase at least fourfold over the next five years, and cell chemistry is moving to nickel-rich cathodes. what are the developments and challenges on the battery raw-materials side? ken hoffman (expert, new jersey): there are three main challenges for the battery raw-materials supply stream. first, will the industry produce the quality of the nickel, lithium, and cobalt necessary? second, will it produce the extremely specific quality needed? third, can this production meet the ever more stringent environmental, social, and governance requirements imposed by regulators?what will enable a truly sustainable form of electric mobility in the future? where does the industry stand on sourcing raw materials sustainably, green electricity, and battery recycling? is awareness of these challenges increasing?hauke engel (partner, frankfurt): the journey to truly sustainable electric mobil-ity has only begun. the industry has made great progress increasing the number of available hybrid and fully electric-vehicle models, and costs keep coming down. now the industry must work hard to drive down the cost of batteries and to achieve end-to-end sustainability from truly sustainable raw-materials supplies (such as zero-car-bon steel) to circular-economy principles in vehicle design. i2019m excited to see oems increasingly starting to recognize and embrace these challenges. the scale and complexity of the problems may seem daunting, and solving them will require imagination, determination, and new forms of collaboration. failure is not an option. we must simultaneously solve the climate challenge and secure the prosperity of our automotive industries and the people they employ.ev market trends vary by region key ev markets suggest shifting regional dynamics, with china and the united states losing ground to europe. ev sales remained constant in china in 2019, at around 1.2 million units sold (a 3 percent increase from the previous year). in the united states, ev sales dropped by 12 percent in 2019, with only 320,000 units sold. meanwhile, sales in europe rose by 44 percent, to reach 590,000 units. these trends continued in first-quarter 2020 as ev sales decreased from the previous quarter by 57 percent in china and by 33 percent in the united states. in contrast, europe's ev market increased by 25 percent. china the relatively slow 2019 growth of china's ev market reflects both an overall decline in the light-vehicle market and significant cuts in ev subsidies. the central government, for example, eliminated purchase subsidies for vehicles that achieve electric ranges (e-ranges) of less than 200 kilometers and reduced subsidies by 67 percent for battery electric vehicles (bevs) with e-ranges above 400 kilometers. these cutbacks reflect the government's strategy of scaling back monetary incentives for new-energy vehicles (nevs) and transitioning to nonmonetary forms of support. since 2019, oems have received credits for each nev produced. the credits take into consideration factors such as the type of vehicle, as well as its maximum speed, energy consumption, weight, and range. regulators base credit targets for each oem on its total production of passenger cars. if a manufacturer does not reach the target, it must purchase credits from competitors that have a surplus or pay financial penalties.in first-quarter 2020, china was heavily affected by the covid-19 pandemic. ev sales dropped by 57 percent from the fourth quarter of 2019 as consumer demand declined sharply. several ev manufacturers were also forced to halt production. in response, the central government extended through 2022 (though at reduced rates) monetary incentives that were about to expire. the government also prolonged the purchase. mckinsey electric vehicle index: europe cushions a global plunge in ev saleskey ev markets suggest shifting regional dynamics, with china and the united states losing ground to europe.tax exemptions of nevs through 2022. these measures, together with the government's recent decision to invest billions of renminbi in the charging infrastructure as part of an economic-stimulus program, could help ev sales rebound in 2020. the united states ev sales rose by 80 percent in the united states in 2018, driven by the market launch of the standard version of the tesla model 3. the increase slowed in 2019 because of several developments. with tesla's overseas deliveries increasing and the gradual phaseout of the federal tax credit in january and july 2019, the brand's us sales for that year declined 7 percent, or 12,400 units. meanwhile, the chevrolet volt was phased out, and its sales fell by 14,000 units. sales of the honda clarity also decreased by 8,000 units.some international oems did successfully launch new models in the united states in 2019, including audi (the e-tron) and hyundai (the kona). sales of vw's e-golf also increased. these three brands accounted for more than 24,500 units of ev sales, but their strong performance could not offset the decline of other models. us sales of evs decreased further in first-quarter 2020, by 33 percent from the previous quarter. the federal government's recent moves to loosen regulations could further decelerate the ev market in the united states. in march 2020, for instance, the government revised fuel-economy standards, to a 2026 target of 40 miles per gallon (mpg), from 54 mpg. today's low oil prices are also contributing to the ev slowdown, since they significantly lower the total cost of ownership for vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines (as compared with evs). these changes are creating great uncertainty, and the us ev market's development could depend largely on the number of states adopting california's zero-emission vehicle program and on the vicissitudes of oil prices.europeunlike other key ev markets, europe has seen significant ev growth. in 2019, sales increased by 44 percent, the highest rate since 2016. the european union's new emissions standard 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer for passenger cars could also boost ev sales because it stipulates that 95 percent of the fleet must meet this standard in 2020 and 100 percent in 2021. bev sales picked up speed substantially, with a 70 percent growth rate propelled by three models: the tesla model 3, hyundai kona, and audi e-tron. ev sales increased by double-digit percentages in 2019 in almost every european country. sales in some smaller markets, such as estonia, iceland, and slovakia, declined in absolute terms. ev sales in germany and the netherlands contributed nearly half 44 percent of overall ev-market growth in europe; in both countries, units sold increased by about 40,000 units. those numbers translate into a 2018 growth rate of 55 percent for germany and 144 percent for the netherlands. in both countries, these strong ev sales resulted from increased demand for new models, the availability of existing models with larger battery sizes, and changed government incentives (for more information on the power of incentives, see sidebar purchase subsidies juice ev sales.)mckinsey electric vehicle index: europe cushions a global plunge in ev salespurchase subsidies juice ev sales as recent developments in china and europe show, government subsidies remain a major driver of electric-vehicle (ev) sales. in 2019, several countries changed these incentive schemes in ways that show how sensitive customers are to price ad-justments. for instance, the ev market in china declined by 31 percent in the second half of the year after the government cut subsidies. in the united kingdom, sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (phevs) fell by 15 percent after the government stopped subsidies for hybrids. government subsidies also play an important role in increasing growth. when germany reduced the company-car tax in january 2019, it promoted a surge in ev sales later that year. similarly, the strong 2019 showing of the ev market in the netherlands occurred partly because consumers wanted to pur-chase vehicles before the benefit-in-kind tax rate increased in 2020. as first-quarter 2020 figures show, the ev markets in several european countries could accelerate this year because of recently increased incentives: 2014 france revised its bonus malus (reward penalty) scheme, based on carbon-dioxide emissions. companies must meet new requirements to receive the environmental bonus for low-emitting vehicles and face a drastic increase in the environmental penalty for high-emitting ones. 2014 germany extended tax incentives for electric company cars through the end of 2030. it has also increased purchase-price subsidies for evs and will continue them until the end of 2021.  sweden implemented a bonus malus system in 2018. a january 2020 amendment for test procedures to determine the carbon-dioxide emissions of vehicles will benefit phevs. while government subsidies obviously have a strong influence on the development of the ev market, future growth may depend largely on the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic hits ev markets in the short term. in the first quarter of 2020, european ev sales rose as the overall ev penetration rate increased to 7.5 percent. with the exception of hong kong, all of the top ten markets for ev penetration were in europe (exhibit 2). the strong regulatory tailwinds and high purchase incentives in several european countries could dampen the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and further boost the ev market. that said, ev sales will probably face tougher impediments in second-quarter 2020, when the pandemic's impact on europe's countries and economies should peak. so far, no european oem has changed its plans to roll out ev models, and several countries are discussing additional purchase incentives as part of their economic-stimulus programs.electric-vehicle makers are debuting new models and boosting sales of existing one automakers launched 143 new electric vehicles 105 bevs and 38 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (phevs)in 2019. they plan to introduce around 450 additional models by 2022 (exhibit 3). most are midsize or large vehicles. given the estimated production levels, german manufacturers, with an expected volume of 856,000 evs, could overtake chinese players in 2020. that would boost germany's global production share from 18 percent in 2019 to 27 percent in 2020. new emissions regulations in europe and china, which will come into force between 2020 and 2021, partly explain why ev-model launches have increased significantly. these regulations pose major challenges for automakers, since they will face potential penalties of up to several billion euros unless they increase their ev penetration rates significantly.among ev manufacturers, tesla continued as market leader in 2019, with 370,000 units sold globally, for a market share of about 16 percent, up from 12 percent in 2018 (exhibit 4). the launch of the model 3 outside of the united states was the main reason for this surge. with 300,000 units 8mckinsey electric vehicle index: europe cushions a global plunge in ev sales web , nine of the top ten markets for electric-vehicle penetration rate were european. nine of the top ten markets for electric-vehicle penetration rate were european. the model 3 outpaced sales of the bjev eu-series threefold and sales of nissan leaf fourfold.at the brand level, most chinese ev manufacturers faced declining sales, while demand was high for the ev offerings of some international oems. the supply chain is localizing with announced launches of new ev models spiking, both automakers and suppliers are increasing their global footprints in target markets by localizing the production of vehicles and components. for example, tesla began construction of its shanghai plant in january 2019 and delivered the first locally produced ev that december. the company plans to build its next production plant in germany by 2021. similarly, volkswagen and toyota have announced plans to set up ev plants in china. in a similar development, battery-cell manufacturers are increasing their production capacities in target markets. the total lithium-ion battery market. about 450 new electric-vehicle models will be launched through 2022. new models by car size, number battery electric vehicles a/b segment, c segment, d/e segment others.plug-in hybrid electric vehicles source: ihs light vehicle powertrain forecast, may 2020. range-extended electric vehicles for ev passenger cars grew by 17 percent, to 117 gigawatt-hours in 2019, enough to power 2.4 million standard bevs. most of the new capacity will be established in central europe, with companies preparing to meet demand throughout the region. company announcements suggest that the global market should expand to about 1,000 gigawatt-hours by 2025. the chinese battery maker catl had the largest market share in 2019, at 28 percent, while its absolute capacity grew by 39 percent. catl has recently continued its global expansion, signing new contracts with several international oems and setting up a factory in germany. south korean manufacturers are trying to catch up with large-scale investments in new overseas production plants. sk innovation, for example, announced it would invest an additional 5 billion in its planned us factory, while lg chem is investing $2.3 billion in a joint venture (jv) with general motors in the united states. overall, jvs are becoming a popular collaboration model in the battery industry, with an increasing number of partnerships announced in 2019. this trend mainly reflects the fact that jvs enable automakers to lock in enough capacity to reach their ambitious sales and production targets. automakers also prefer multisourcing strategies involving a number of cell makers. even tesla, which used to rely solely on cells from panasonic, signed new contracts with catl and lg chem for the chinese market in 2019.tesla increased its global market share to about 16 percent in 2019, with the tesla increased its global market share to about 16 percent in 2019, with the model 3 alone accounting for 13 percent of sales.model 3 alone accounting for 13 percent of sales.electronic vehicle world sales database, ev-volumes.com;the ev market has grown quickly, but the dynamics vary by region. in key markets, the transition from ices to electric powertrains reached a tipping point in 2019, fueled by more stringent emissions regulations, access restrictions in cities, advancing ev technologies that lengthen driving ranges and cut prices, and the expansion of the charging network. the same forces will further expand uptake over the coming years, but their evolution will vary by market. to win, automakers and suppliers must develop a detailed view of what's happening in each market by monitoring the regulatory environment, customer preferences, infrastructure development, and the moves of competitors2014especially new entrants, including start-ups from outside the industry. companies that match customer demand with suitable ev models and catch regulatory tailwinds may secure the most promising pockets of growth going forward.

At Auto OEMs, procurement processes for hardware purchases have largely been optimized as they have high familiarity with the manufacturing methods. The same is not true for software, as procurement teams understand little about SW development. The authors suggest that analytics-based cost algorithms and agile-inspired methods can help OEMs reduce automotive SW costs by up to 30% and improve delivery timelines.

this method, which incorporates both digital technologies and agile principles, involves using clean-sheet techniques to create a bottom-up estimate of a supplier's production costs and margins. as its name suggests, should costing helps companies distinguish between the set price of goods or services and their true value.the should-costing method is now the gold standard for hardware purchases at automotive companies, but largely absent from software procurement. while this oversight may seem surprising, the explanation is simple: most automotive procurement groups are familiar with hardware suppliers and their work processes but understand relatively little about software development. those companies that can overcome this knowledge gap and apply should costing to their software projects stand to win big, since experience suggests they can potentially reduce costs by up to 30 percent while simultaneously improving delivery time frames. strong growth is expected for the

verification,and validation services software (functions, operating system, middleware)software should costing: a new procurement tool for automotive companies the challenge of automotive software procurement although oems want to capture vehicle control points and develop at least a portion of their differentiating software in-house, most still rely heavily on external hardware and software suppliers to provide customized solutions. software that enables some critical vehicle functions, such as connectivity and battery management, is often sourced externally. likewise, software pure-play companies frequently design algorithms for vehicle systems, including machine-learning programs that control autonomous driving. the situation is similar at traditional tier-1 and tier-2 suppliers, who often draw on the expertise of their own software vendors when serving traditional automotive companies. the same reliance on external sources also holds true when oems are looking for customized software to run different areas of their businesses for instance, ai-powered, vision-based quality- control systems for manufacturing or pricing and forecasting algorithms for sales. among suppliers, the ongoing digital transformation is prompting more it departments to outsource a larger share of their software development because they are struggling to meet increased demand from the business side. this pattern holds true even among traditionally cost-focused it functions. shortcomings during automotive-software procurement negotiations automotive stakeholders may be buying more software, but their procurement groups are still getting up to speed in this area. they have far to go before they can deliver a fact-based view of software costs because they do not have the tools and capabilities required to create an objective, accurate view of what products and services should cost. software remains a mysterious black box for procurement groups who often struggle with cost negotiations because they lack complete knowledge of suppliers and their development processes. they have few predeveloped best practices that they can apply, since most advanced, high-tech players typically produce most of their software in-house, on a proprietary basis. by contrast, they have hardware experts with indepth understanding of suppliers, including their manufacturing techniques, and can easily estimate costs to specific goods and services.most automotive procurement groups are familiar with hardware suppliers and their work processes but understand relatively little about software development.the widespread benefits of should costing for automotive software the lack of transparency about software development and associated costs can have major repercussions. first, and perhaps most important, it often leads automakers and tier-1 suppliers to pay too much for code. an estimated 10 to 30 percent gap exists between the best-offered cost and the should-costing figure (exhibit 2). the value at stake can amount to hundreds of millions of dollars for a typical oem or large tier-1 supplier. software should costing, which is the best way to attain complete transparency, relies on a clean-sheet, bottom-up model of the production process to estimate a supplier's costs and margins. it helps turn software development from a single black box to a gray one and ultimately to a set of small, individual, full-color elements that clearly show all relevant cost drivers and deliverables. with this level of detail, buyers can move from a purely commercial discussion with suppliers and undertake a fact-based, point-by-point examination of the goods and services under negotiation. among other benefits, the should-costing method can help companies understand the financial impact of various deal elements, such as suggested team size, colocation, project duration, and the share of the workforce located in best-cost countries. for products, it allows companies to see how different feature sets or solution architectures will affect costs. ultimately, the should-costing method also helps de-risk software delivery and product launches by allowing procurement groups to answer important questions, including:  how do we evaluate the actual competitiveness of a single offer?  are we receiving the maximum service for our money? how can we tell if the productivity and cost performance of our vendors are competitive, and how can we improve them? these questions are becoming even more relevant as software increases in complexity and development requires many engineers and advanced skills.should-costing methods can reduce software costs by 10 to 30 percent.should-costing methods can reduce software costs by 10 to 30 percent.costing benefits:improves negotiations through fact-based conversations on product price components informs knowledgeable discussion of supplier's team size, co-location plans, and project duration derisks software development by enhancing control and allowing oems to challenge the supplier during development helps to create interoperability regarding different feature sets or solution architectures. gaining a shared, detailed understanding of software development costs allows oems and suppliers to develop and grow together. it is the first step in a collaborative journey where cost drivers are not just negotiation points but common problems that both companies will tackle, step by step. the options for should costing when purchasing software, most oem procurement departments simply request detailed proposals from suppliers that break down costs, including those associated with individual features or specific team roles, such as architects, developers, and testers (exhibit 3). purchasing managers then compare the various offers and use them to negotiate a best of best feature set and price across different suppliers. while this cost approach provides an effective basis for negotiations and supplier-performance management, it does not convey a true understanding of cost drivers. as they move to should costing, oems can select from two methods: the t-shirt sizing approach and the complexity-point analysis. estimating the cost of software via the t-shirt sizing approach the fastest and easiest should-costing method involves applying a structured engineering technique frequently used during agile development sprints. this approach is common at many tech companies and involves asking experts to make relative estimates, rather than absolute estimates, because people are more likely to understand their significance. since relative estimates may be difficult to visualize in relation to software, consider how the same process might work with clothes sizing. when looking at an extra-large t-shirt , people might not appreciate how big it is. but the extent of its volume becomes obvious when it is placed next to an extra-small t-shirt.three options

including project/resource plansanalytics-driven black box. should-costing techniques, already used for hardware purchasing, must expand to cover software purchasing to help companies obtain the best value for their money.when applying the t-shirt sizing approach to high-complexity custom software, expert teams first break the software into manageable parts for example, looking at the software by function or customer requirement. second, the teams define size, following the t-shirt approach, by comparing the parts to reference projects. the teams typically include about six steps, from extra-small to extra-extra-large, often using that same terminology. the estimates follow the relative size of a fibonacci series to offset the uncertainties inherent in larger projects. finally, they convert the size estimate into a cost value by assigning one t-shirt size an absolute value (for instance, in man hours or dollars), typically based on historical in-house projects. one automotive company created a t-shirt sizing model for a common electronic control unit (ecu). by breaking down the application and base software layers into individual parts, the team was able to have a detailed discussion about the full or partial re-use of individual features in the next-generation ecu. this strategy helped reduce development costs by over 25 percent from the initial estimates.while t-shirt sizing has the advantage of speed, it does not allow teams to make comparisons across different projects, including those run by other expert groups. t-shirt sizing also uses a limited set of projects for comparison, and the resulting estimates do not typically include any effects related to schedule constraints or best-cost location. machine-learning-based complexity-point analysis approach in a complexity-point analysis, companies use a set of reference projects against which they make standardized comparisons. with very complex and large software applications that take years of development and numerous engineers, the process first breaks the software down into blocks of manageable complexity. typically, the blocks are based on functionalities of customer requirements and communication needs. for each building block, teams estimate the key complexity drivers, which typically include the number of required tests, variants, and lines of code as well as the code type (for instance, new versus legacy). teams also considernon-functionall requirements, such as safety.for smaller and more limited software applications, companies can improve their initial estimate by generating detailed pseudocode and data structures to calculate the number of functional points. they then correlate this information with the needs of overall system features, such as real-time requirements or parallel computation.after these steps, players can convert the identified effort drivers into the actual cost and effort (for instance, engineering hours) required to deliver the project through comparisons with a set of relevant reference projects. 1 a series of numbers starting with 0 and 1 in which each number is the sum of the two earlier numbers. the most advanced complexity-point analyses employ machine-learning algorithms to select the best reference projects for the comparison, based on available information. for example, one mckinsey solution involves having teams estimate the total effort required by breaking it down into a project plan that includes staffing needs in various roles over time. the teams also provide a total cost estimate, including those associated with trade-offs, and compare them to those listed in a large database of software projects. for instance, teams might consider whether having all team members in one location would decrease the number of employees in best-cost countries, thereby raising project costs. a complexity-point analysis typically requires a limited effort, although that can vary depending on type of inputs, but it provides a precise and objective result comparable across projects. this analysis also allows companies to set constraints, such as a project start and end date, the number of simultaneous necessary resources, and staffing requirements. all these factors can influence team productivity and are important to consider when conducting fact-based negotiations with suppliers to lower costs and optimize project execution.when estimating the chances of a project's success compared to reference projects, or when conducting scenario analyses, teams can adjust project constraints. for example, they can determine how accelerating the timeline would increase project costs, or look at trade-offs between the value of individual software features and their respective development costs. the increasing importance of custom, high-complexity software for automotive oems and suppliers is compelling procurement departments to monitor software spending more closely and improve their toolboxes. they must go far beyond basic comparisons of requests for proposal to find the best price. should-costing techniques, already well established for hardware purchasing, must expand to cover software purchasing to help companies obtain the best value for their money. oems and tier-1 suppliers late to this party may soon regret it."
McKinsey - Pandemic Leaving a Permanent Shift to Online European Grocery Sales (Dec-20).pdf,"A survey conducted this year revealed that some grocery-shopping behaviors acquired during the pandemic are expected to stay among consumers in UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Key themes: 1) After a surge in online buying during the height of lockdowns, theres been a decline but are still higher than they were pre-pandemic; 2) 15% shopped for groceries on a website they had never used before; 3) the share of online sales continues growing at a faster rate than prior to the crisis; and 4) the availability of delivery slots will be critical for grocers to remain competitive.","retail practice how european shoppers will buy groceries in the next normal as the covid-19 pandemic continues, early evidence shows that some but not all of europeans new grocery-shopping habits will stick.consumers changed the way they shopped for groceries during the lockdowns related to the covid-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020, and their shopping behaviors have continued to evolve during the crisis. once the crisis abates, to what extent will consumers revert to their pre-pandemic grocery-shopping behaviors? will some of the new behaviors stick and become more pervasive? if so, which ones? behavioral science tells us that it takes an average of two months to form a new habit, which will stick only if reinforced through routines and rewards. in this article, we examine the grocery-shopping behaviors of consumers in the eu-5 (france, germany, italy, spain, and the united kingdom). and we identify five themes that have become increasingly evident among these consumers that could outlast the pandemic, based on early evidence from the consumer-sentiment surveys we have conducted across the globe from march 2020 through september 2020. the five themes are a steady (but slower) migration to online shopping, a focus on healthy eating, a shift to value, gains for big brands (although perhaps temporary in some categories), and increased importance of purpose. we also offer our initial thoughts on the implications for grocery retailers and consumer-packaged goods (cpg) manufacturers in the next normal. after a surge in online buying, a muted return to stores as lockdowns went into effect across markets in the spring of 2020 because of the covid-19 pandemic, eu-5 consumers shifted to online grocery shopping because of restrictions on movement and concerns about exposure to other people in indoor public spaces. online sales of groceries surged.in april, the demand for online groceries more than doubled in italy.in the united kingdom, tesco's online grocery business went up to 16 percent of total country sales in the first quarter of 2020, from about 9 percent.online supermarket ocado retail reported in april a tenfold increase in demand and web traffic up to 100 times higher than pre-pandemic levels.and online growth could have been much higher, since consumer demand for online ordering has exceeded available supply throughout the crisis and continues today in most markets. throughout the pandemic, about 15 percent of surveyed eu-5 consumers have shopped for groceries on a website that they had never used before. among those consumers, more than 50 percent say they intend to continue shopping at their newfound site for at least some part of their grocery needs. additionally, 12 percent of them have also switched to different grocery stores to take throughout the pandemic, about 15 percent of surveyed eu-5 consumers have shopped for groceries on a website that they had never used before. mckinsey is fielding consumer surveys to understand the impact of the covid-19 crisis on consumer sentiment and stated behavior. the surveys, now fielded in 35 countries, are conducted online in local languages on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis, depending on the region. for the latest survey results, see global surveys of consumer sentiment during the coronavirus crisis .eu-5 consumers had mixed results with online grocery shopping.eu-5 consumers had mixed results with online grocery shopping.advantage of home delivery or click-and-collect services, both accessible via online ordering. but not everyone has liked their online grocery shopping experience. uk respondents have had the most positive experiences with online grocery ordering and delivery, with 33 percent of home-delivery users saying they are very satisfied201d and just 5 percent saying they are strongly dissatisfied (exhibit 1). the united kingdom has the most developed online-grocery market in europe, with 6.5 to 6.9 percent overall penetration in 2020 (compared with 5.0 percent in france, 1.7 percent in spain, 1.5 percent in germany, and 0.7 percent in italy),5 so it isn't surprising that uk grocers were better placed to respond to surges in online demand. other grocers simply didn't have the infrastructure to serve the surge of online consumers, and our research reflects the correlation between customer satisfaction and the ability to keep up with demand. in italy, france, and germany, only 13 to 16 percent of respondents feel very satisfied with their online grocery.furthermore, even some customers who are very satisfied with their online shopping experiences say they view online grocery shopping as a temporary measure and plan to return to physical stores. indeed, according to our september survey across eu-5 consumers, the only country where consumers expect to increase their online grocery shopping is the united kingdom, with a net intent of +5 percent. other consumers expect to reduce their online grocery shopping, with net intent of 1 percent reported in france, 10 percent in germany, 12 per cent in spain, and 14 percent in italy. that said, online sales are still higher than they were before the pandemic. a new subset of people who tried online grocery shop ping during the pandemic have found that they enjoy it and will continue to use it. we thus expect the share of online sales to continue growing at a faster rate than it did prior to the covid-19 crisis.  we are very much still in the heart of the crisis. according to our september survey, 63 percent of eu-5 consumers say they aren't resuming normal (prepandemic) out-of-home activities while they wait for their governments to lift restrictions, for a vaccine to become available, or for medical authorities to deem activities safe. in the united kingdom and spain, 73 percent and 72 percent of the population, respectively, still isn2019t back to normal out-of-home activities, while in germany, italy, and france, the shares are 62 percent, 58 percent, and 51 percent, respectively.what will this mean for the postpandemic grocery landscape? one implication is that the availability of delivery slots2014so that consumers can order and receive groceries when they need them2014will be critical to staying competitive. grocers with an in-store picking model2014in which online orders are fulfilled in the store for delivery or pickup2014have found it easier than those without one to meet online demand and ramp up deliveries because the model's limited capital expenditures and shorter drive times allow for more flexibility. online- only retailers, with no stores to deliver from, found it more difficult to meet the demand surge, although there are some exceptions (such as italy's cortilia, a food retailer that has continued to grow its fresh-food-delivery service). with so much time at home, a focus on health but also fun cooking from scratch and buying fresh products have been prevalent behaviors during the covid-19 pandemic (exhibit 2). more than half of eu-5 survey respondents and up to 85 percent in some countries report that a focus on healthy foods is a very important consideration in their weekly grocery shopping. the behavioral shift is particularly pronounced among (but not limited to) younger consumers. among both generation z and millennial consumers, approximately 35 percent cook meals from scratch more often than they did prior to the covid-19 crisis, as do 23 percent of gen xers and 17 percent of baby boomers. eu-5 consumers were already conscious of their food choices before the pandemic, with 25 to 30 percent of uk consumers reporting in january 2020 that they had very active201d food goals or followed specific diets.7 during the pandemic, food has become even more central to consumers2019 lives. home has been recast as the new restaurant, with heightened health consciousness (though with some allowances, since home is also the new pub and new center of entertainment, reflected in skyrocketing sales of baking products, alcohol, and snacks).as consumer needs and preferences continue to change, the offerings from retailers and cpg companies will need to evolve as well. in times of economic and public-health distress, that might mean helping customers find inspiration for healthy, fun, and affordable meals that they can make from scratch.value critical for price-sensitive consumers about 25 percent of survey respondents report that their personal finances have been negatively affected by the covid-19 crisis. and short-term forecasts indicate a recessionary environment, even as the overall macroeconomic forecasts show a vaguely u-shape recovery. based on previous recessions, we expect price sensitivity to continue to affect retail. the current recession, however, has the added element of an increased amount of time spent at home, which has led to higher grocery sales. how extreme will the rise in price sensitivity prove to be? 7 mckinsey consumer research, january 2020.5how european shoppers will buy groceries in the next normalour research shows that at the end of june 2020, consumers expected to further reduce their spending on all categories except groceries2014where they expected to spend more, with a net intent of +4 percent. we are seeing that intention reflected in behavior that is more cautious, such as the increased use of shopping lists to reduce impulse buying. in june, 29 percent of uk respondents were shopping based on a list versus 21 percent in april; in germany, the shares were 16 percent in june versus 6 percent in april.when surveyed during lockdown, most consumers who had switched to cheaper versions of the products they usually buy said they were less likely to continue buying the cheaper versions after the lockdowns had lifted. but in our june survey, more consumers had traded down than hadn2019t in italy and spain. and we see a similar trend of trading down happening in germany and the united kingdom (exhibit 3). it's likely that price pressure will intensify further, particularly on discretionary products (such as alcohol and premium fresh produce).according to our september 2020 survey, uk consumers have traded down the most, with 33 per-cent of those who have changed their shopping behaviors reporting that they have switched to less

and 20 percent of uk respondents were already doing so before the pandemic. we see the most profound behavior changes in germany, where just 6 percent of consumers were trading down in 2019 but 24 percent have done so in 2020 (exhibit 4). in june, a number of the surveyed eu-5 consumers (22 percent in italy, 19 percent in the united kingdom, 13 percent in france, 13 percent in spain, and 7 percent in germany) who had shopped at brick-and-mortar stores during the crisis had switched to a different primary grocer. and they did so mainly based on convenience, with 33 percent of consumers who had changed stores citing proximity as the main reason for doing so. the survey results also suggest that consumers may stay with their new stores if the price is right: 25 percent of those who had switched stores say they did so because of lower prices. in september, the surveyed consumers were continuing to try out new retailers, with similar shares (19 percent in italy, 17 percent in the united kingdom, 13 percent in france, 11 percent in spain, and 5 percent in germany) reporting a primary-grocer switch. consumers' motivations, however, had changed, with price as the primary driver: 28 percent of respondents who had changed stores cite better value as the reason, and 27 percent cite better prices and promotions. but location remains important, with 26 percent of respondents who had switched moving to a store closer to their homes. and the shares of respondents who are looking for more ways to save money when shopping than they did before the crisis are approximately 44 percent in spain, 36 percent in both italy and the united kingdom, 27 percent in france, and 23 percent in germany.we expect that price will continue to take priority over proximity when choosing a store, especially in how european shoppers will buy groceries in the next normal households facing economic pressure. we may thus see a shake-up among grocery players as they battle for consumer loyalty. for retailers, that means that now is a critical time to invest in retaining their newly gained customers. gains by big brands may not stick within the cpg industry, small brands have had the lion's share of growth in recent years. in the united states, small brands accounted for 50 percent of value growth between 2017 and 2019, although they contributed just 11 percent of revenues in 2016. that growth was fueled largely by consumer preference for small brands authenticity and uniqueness, with the help of investments from the venture-capital industry. in efforts to capitalize on the trend, large cpg companies have devoted significant attention and effort into building, acquiring, and incubating small brands2014and have been increasingly successful in doing so. but the covid-19 pandemic has revived some large brands. in the first months of lockdowns, surveyed consumers in most eu-5 countries said they preferred well-known brands versus trying new, smaller brands (exhibit 5). availability was clearly a major reason: during full lockdowns in march and april 2020, large cpg companies were able to keep up with demand, while smaller players struggled to make products available because of supply-chain challenges and retailers cutting down skus. the big-brand revival, however, might be short lived. early signs suggest that consumers' interest in small brands is returning. across eu-5 markets, the net purchase intent exhibit 5during lockdowns, consumers stuck with big brands.during lockdowns, consumers stuck with big brands.shopping habits during

will buy groceries in the next normalof smaller or lesser-known brands was 9 percent in june, compared with 15 percent in march. over time, we expect small brands to return to their previous growth trajectory. our survey results show that brand authenticity and provenance are increasingly important to consumers, and that will likely benefit the small brands that are resilient enough to weather the crisis. some small brands won't recover, but others will continue to grow, and new ones will enter the market. some large brands will also improve their growth profiles for the long term, in part by acquiring small brands. a stronger sense of purpose consumers increasingly value retailers and brands with a purpose. while healthy food is still the main priority for surveyed consumers' weekly grocery shopping, consumers are also conscious of the values and purpose of the brands they are buying (exhibit 6). we have seen an increase in overall net sentiment across environmental and ethical product attributes as consumers have more choices about where to shop and what to buy. in italy, net sentiment toward brands with strong values and purpose reached 49 percent in june 2020. and across france, germany, spain, and the united kingdom, about one-fourth of respondents see brands' values as important. that sentiment has remained true through september, with 18 percent of respondents buying more sustainable and eco-friendly products, and 12 percent report buying more from brands based on their purpose than they did at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic. during and after the 2008-09 recession, it was important for consumers that large companies exhibit 6in food shopping, health remains a priority for consumers, but increasingly, in food shopping, health remains a priority

percent of consumers in various countries said they expected corporations to operate in ways that align with society's interests, even if it meant sacrificing shareholder value. in the current crisis, early evidence suggests that the importance of social responsibility has accelerated for consumers. eu-5 survey respondents report strong intent to support local stores and brands that demonstrate care and concern for their staff and that use and promote sustainable solutions. against this backdrop, retailers and cpg manufacturers should be ever-more mindful of their roles in society as responsible and purpose-led employers, providers of essential goods and services, and pillars of their communities. in the current extraordinary times, consumer behaviors continue to change, and the themes we have discussed in this article will likely evolve in nuanced ways. cpg companies and retailers must closely monitor such changes. their strategy, category-management, innovation, and consumer insights teams should closely collaborate to develop price-point, brand, and category offers that address consumer needs in both online and offline channels. and finally, as the world works through the unprecedented humanitarian and economic crisis related to the covid-19 pandemic, companies should reassess and strengthen their corporate purposes2014and bring them to the forefront. the positive impact of purpose-led actions could last long after the pandemic ends."

To remain competitive, dealers will need to tailor to the consumer throughadigital portal that startswith discovery and endsin delivery, better pricing and inventory, and exceptional customer service.","the car-buying experience in 2030, in this interview, the former chief strategy officer of cars.com predicts a seamless digital process for car buyers and a necessary evolution for dealers.from 2018 to 2020, matthew gold was the chief strategy officer of cars.com one of the world's largest digital marketplaces for automobiles, with a reported 2019 annual revenue of $606.7 million where he was responsible for enterprise strategy, new-business development, corporate development, and strategic partnerships. gold previously worked at google as head of strategy and operations for emerging-market partnerships at youtube, as well as at google consumer surveys. he recently spoke with mckinsey's inga maurer about how consumers will buy cars in the future. the following is an edited version of their remarks. let's begin with the consumer perspective. surveys show that people generally don't enjoy the car-buying experience; they don't trust car salespeople and they don't like the negotiation process. what will the car-buying process look like in 2030? matthew gold: there will be two major changes to the car-buying process a decade down the road, and both already have the groundwork laid. the first involves many more options for where and how we buy cars in the us. some could involve a dealership, some might not. that's a huge change in how we think about auto retail in the us. and we're already seeing some of that. in new-car sales we're seeing tesla go direct to consumer, and in used-car sales we're seeing carvana find digital ways to reach consumers directly without a traditional car-dealer experience. the second major change is that you will see much, much more of this process move online. this has also already started. but by 2030, you will see the full auto-retail process becomes digital. everything from discovery, what car is right for me?all the way through the transaction itself. so you'll be able to buy the car online all the way through delivery without setting foot in an auto showroom if you choose not to. the days when you walk in a dealership uncertain of the exact car you want, and not 100 percent sure how you'll pay for it, or what you're going to pay, or whether you'll lease or finance, who your lender will be those days will be a thing of the past.you'll go into the dealer already knowing exactly what you want, what you should pay for it and how, and what add-ons you want. that will significantly decrease the amount of time you spend in the dealership. it will also decrease the opportunities for traditional sellers to [work] add-ons into the car-buying process. today a lot of the car-buying margin comes from add-ons. those [sales] will be a lot harder in the future when the customer already knows what they want the moment they walk in. mckinsey: in that scenario, personalization will be critical, right? how personalized will car buying be a decade down the road?
matthew gold: personalization is the future of not only auto retail but also retail as a whole. and the leveraging of big data the incredible stitching together of data about customers will be the future of the car-buying experience. that means a bunch of different things. one is that the amount of time customers spend going through the car-buying funnel will dramatically decrease, which is a good thing. there'll be a lot less searching and a lot more finding. the days of sifting through thousands of cars to figure out which one you want are over. instead, algorithms will do the searching for you. they will integrate data that you provide and that other brokers already have.you won't have to enter a bunch of information into fields. it'll know what's right for you, and it'll make smart choices. so instead of going onto craigslist or a dealer's website and scrolling through inventory, you could just say [to your virtual assistant], find me a used car.and it will do all the math and all the work behind the scenes to figure out exactly which car you need, what's available, what you should pay for it, what you can afford to pay for it, and how to go and pick it up. and it'll probably even make the pickup appointment for you.mckinsey: what are the implications for dealerships in 2030?matthew gold: from the dealership perspective, this means having the tools available to cut down search time. otherwise, customers will go elsewhere we've seen this time and time again. the quality of recommendations from search engines will dramatically increase customer satisfaction and their willingness to use the platform.dealers will need to get much smarter about understanding their customers and about offering a sales experience that makes sense for each customer. the days of the salesperson asking, so what brought you in today? should be over. the dealer should already know that. they should already have the cars waiting. they should already have payment packages designed and ready. being in a place where the entire shopping experience can be customized to the individual buyer will go from being a luxury to being the norm and the expectation.in other words, dealers will have to adapt and change. i don't think the dealership is obsolete. there will continue to be a role for local auto dealerships in a variety of different markets in the us and overseas. what will be different is that dealers will have to compete with other players they are not used to competing with including oems that sell direct and digital used-car players. and they're going to have to compete with one another in new ways over longer distances. the monopoly that the local dealer had over customers in its own geographic area is probably gone.mckinsey: as we speak, the covid-19 pandemic is still very much top of mind for most of the world. will the auto industry feel any long-term effects from this crisis in 2030?matthew gold: it's a little too early to tell. what we're seeing is people pushing more and more of their retail experience online. and they're pushing less and less of their purchase time into the dealership because of physical-distancing requirements.i saw a figure the other day: 10 percent of carmax's sales recently were done via delivery. the question is going to be how much of that is pushed into a post-covid-19 world. i think you2019re going to see covid-19 accelerate a change that was already slated to happen. people are going to get much more comfortable with many more choices; dealers are going to realize that they have no choice but to accommodate those choices. i don't think people are going to jettison the dealer experience the moment covid-19 ends, but i do think you're going to see increased comfort on both sides of the transaction with a digital auto-buying experience.mckinsey: given the future that you've described, what kinds of investments should dealers make today to win in 2030?matthew gold: today's local dealers in the united states need to do two things to maintain their competitiveness and role in the car-buying process. the first is they need to invest in a series of end-to-end digital partnerships to make sure that the offering that they have is similar to, if not better than, what's being offered by the digital-only players. building a digital-portal-type experience that starts with targeting and discovery and ends with delivery, and that is seamless and easy and all works together is going to be a vital requirement to stay competitive in the future.two, dealers need to invest in customer service. dealers are going to need to give car shoppers a reason to choose to come into the showroom. it's not enough to be a slightly better car salesperson. you have to look at retail brands known for their service experiences and say, what can we learn? what can we incorporate into our service experience, beyond the bottle of water and a cup of coffee, that can make customers come into the dealership or choose our dealership instead of going to an online-only player? if you don2019t do that, you're going to face a world in which customers will choose not to engage. mckinsey: let's talk about autonomous vehicles (avs). mckinsey analysis suggests they'll account for up to 13 percent of new-car sales volume. do you agree with that estimate? will the car-buying process differ for consumers who want avs versus traditional cars? matthew gold: i think it's important to first define what we mean by autonomous vehicles. there are two different concepts of an autonomous vehicle. one looks a lot like the jetsons: a rideshare but without a driver2014fleet-based, completely automated. you get in the car, punch in an address, off it goes. you have no control over it; everything is automated. all the systems work together in a way where not only is no human required but there's also no human wanted.  i would be skeptical about significant adoption of that kind of technology over the next decade. the other concept of av is a feature that's like cruise control. we already have some adaptive cruise control that maintains the distance between you and the car in front of you. it's a fairly simple system that bounces a wave off the car in front of you, measures the distance, then adjusts your speed to keep that distance. you're going to see these types of av options become more standard. and they're going to become a bigger part of the car-driving experience in some way. there may be a time when you're on a long drive with an empty straightaway ahead, and you may be able to engage autonomous driving to take your hands off the wheel for a few minutes which is a completely different experience than getting into a car that has no driver, no steering wheel. when cruise control came out, the people who bought cruise control were not that different from the people who didn't have it. and it trickled down to pretty much every car. i think over the next ten years you're going to see features of av trickling down into every new car and then every used car that you buy.that, by the way, is really good for people who sell cars, because in a world of truly autonomous vehicles there's no reason to own a car. the capital investment will be managed by a fleet operator. and it doesn2019t matter what kind of car you own. if all you're going to do is rent it for five miles to get to the grocery store and back, then it doesn't matter what brand it is. it doesn't matter if you get the car in the color or specs you want. most cars will be managed through the fleet, and there'll be no or very little differentiation between them. all they'll want to do is manage their costs and manage their service.mckinsey: one final question: what kinds of cutting-edge technology might we see in 2030 that will revolutionize the car-buying experience?matthew gold: i have two examples. one's boring and one is much more exciting. the boring one is dramatic improvements in cross-device stitching and mobile tracking to get better composite understandings of a particular customer. so the ability to gain and integrate large quantities of information about a customer will automate and make the car-buying experience dramatically more fluid in ten years. the second one is ar [augmented reality] and vr [virtual reality]. as we look further into the future, you'll get comfortable with buying a car without having to trek to the showroom. you'll do it all from your couch. everything from, let's see what it looks like in my garage or let's see what it looks like in my work parking lot. we'll be able to try colors and finishes and trim. we'll also be able to virtually test drive. i can have that experience in the comfort of my own home, when i want it, where i want it. it's going to be a hallmark of the process that doesn't exist today."
McKinsey  Early AI Adopters are Increasing AI Investments in Pandemic Response (Dec-20).pdf,"The latest McKinsey Global Survey indicates that AI adoption has not increased since 2019. However, companies that have already adopted AI are using it as a tool for generating value, which increasingly take the form of revenues. While revenue from AI adoption has increased, cost decreases have become less common over time. Overall, early adopters plan to invest even more in AI in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, widening the gap between AI leaders and their competitors.","the state of ai in 2020,since our 2019 survey, artificial intelligence has become more of a revenue driver. companies earning the most from ai plan to invest even more in response to covid-192014and perhaps widen the gap with others.november 2020 image by darby films the results of this year's mckinsey global ai adoption was about equal across regions last survey on artificial intelligence (ai) suggest that year, this year's respondents working for companies organizations are using ai as a tool for generating with headquarters in latin american countries and value. increasingly, that value is coming in the form in other developing countries are much less likely of revenues. a small contingent of respondents than those elsewhere to report that their companies coming from a variety of industries attribute have embedded ai into a process or product in at 20 percent or more of their organizations' least one function or business unit. by industry, respondents in the high-tech and telecom sectors earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) to ai. these companies plan to invest even more in ai are again the most likely to report ai adoption, with in response to the covid-19 pandemic and its the automotive and assembly sector falling just acceleration of all things digital. this could create behind them (down from sharing the lead last year). a wider divide between ai leaders and the majority of companies still struggling to capitalize on the the business functions in which organizations technology; however, these leaders engage in a adopt ai remain largely unchanged from the number of practices that could offer helpful hints for survey, with service operations, product or service success. and while companies overall are making development, and marketing and sales again taking some progress in mitigating the risks of ai, most still the top spots (exhibit 1).have a long way to go.within these functions, the largest shares of respondents report revenue increases for inventory ai adoption and impact and parts optimization, pricing and promotion, customer-service analytics, and sales and demand forecasting. more than two-thirds of respondents while the latest findings show no increase in ai who report adopting each of those use cases say adoption, some companies are capturing value its adoption increased revenue. the use cases from ai at the enterprise level, and many are that most commonly led to cost decreases are generating revenue and cost reductions at least optimization of talent management, contact-center at the function level.automation, and warehouse automation. over half of respondents who report adopting each of those say overall, half of respondents say their organizations the use of ai in those areas reduced costs.have adopted ai in at least one function and while at least one business function.50%of respondents report that their companies have adopted ai in 1 in the 2019 survey, we asked about companies' ai adoption differently, and 58 percent of respondents said that their companies had embedded ai in at least one function or business unit.  the high-tech and telecom sectors include respondents who say they work in broadband communication, call centers, hardware, internet and online services, it services, sales, software, telecom equipment, telecom regulation, wired telecommunications, and wireless communications.ai adoption is highest within the product- or service-development and ai adoption is highest within the product- or service-development and service-operations functions.service-operations functions.ai use cases most commonly adopted

value accrue to the enterprise level. twenty-two percent of respondents say that more than 5 percent of their organizations' enterprise-wide ebit in 2019 was attributable to their use of ai, with 48 percent reporting less than 5 percent. respondents were asked about revenues and costs for the previous year. additionally, in half of the business functions, a larger share of respondents report revenue increases from ai use than in the previous survey, while revenue in most other functions remained stable (exhibit 2). at the same time, cost decreases have become less common in most functions.revenue increases from ai adoption have become more common over time, revenue increases from ai adoption have become more common over time, while while cost decreases have become less

service operations human resources average across all activities.question was asked only of respondents who said their companies adopted ai in a given function. respondents who said no change are not shown.this year we asked about adoption of deep learning a type of machine learning that uses neural networks and can sometimes deliver superior results for the first time. just 16 percent of respondents say their companies have taken deep learning beyond the piloting stage. once again, high-tech and telecom companies are leading the charge, with 30 percent of respondents from those sectors saying their companies have embedded deep-learning capabilities.we've said in the past about following the money to find where ai adds value in organizations still holds true. at the industry level, companies continue to use ai in areas that are most fundamental to where value is generated in each sector. and, overall, many companies focused on growth in 2019 (we asked about last year's revenue and cost effects from ai); for that reason, it's likely that we saw more companies driving revenues with ai rather than decreasing their costs not because ai can't effectively reduce costs. it's also clear that we're still in the early days of ai use in business, with less than a quarter of respondents seeing significant bottom-line impact. this isn't surprising achieving impact at scale is still elusive for many companies not only because of the technical challenges but also because of the organizational changes required. however, those seeing ai contribute more than 20 percent to earnings before interest and taxes are not just from the tech sector. so it is possible for any company to get a good amount of value from ai if it's applied effectively in a repeatable way. most companies seem to agree, with the results showing an appetite to continue investing in the technology. however, there was a bit of a decrease in bullishness this year, perhaps reflecting the passing of ai's hype phase. we do think ai is worth the investment, but it requires effective execution to generate significant value, particularly at enterprise scale.what separates the best from the rest companies seeing the highest bottom-line impact from ai exhibit overall organizational strength and engage in a clear set of core best practices. the companies seeing the most value from their use of ai that is, respondents who say 20 percent or more of enterprise-wide ebit in 2019 was attributable to their ai use report several strengths that set them apart from other respondents4: better overall performance. the findings suggest that companies seeing more ebit contribution from ai experience better year-over-year growth overall than do other companies. respondents at high-performing companies are nearly twice as likely as others to report ebit growth in 2019 of 10 percent or more. better overall leadership. respondents at ai high performers rate their c-suite as very effective more often than other respondents do. they also are much more likely than others to say that their ai initiatives have an engaged and knowledgeable champion in the c-suite. resource commitment to ai. responses show that ai high performers invest more of their digital budgets in ai than their counterparts and are more likely to increase their ai investments in the next three years. high performers also tend to have the ability to develop ai solutions in-house as opposed to purchasing solutions and they typically employ more ai-related talent, such as data engineers, data architects, and translators, than do their counterparts. they also are much more likely than others to say their companies have built a standardized end-to-end platform for ai-related data science, data engineering, and application development.  all questions about ai-related strengths and practices were asked only of respondents who said their organizations had adopted ai in at least one function, n = 1,151.but a few practices are adopted at about the same level by all companies: for example, using test-and-learn methodologies to run rapid iterations in ai initiatives, putting processes in place to capture business feedback, and defining clusters of ai use cases in priority business units, functions, or other areas of business activity.this year we again looked at a broad set of companies' ai-related practices, this time examining about twice as many, to see which might correspond with capturing more value from ai. the organizations with the highest ebit attributable to ai were more likely to engage in nearly every practice than those seeing less value from ai. these practices generally align to six categories: strategy; talent and leadership; ways of working; models, tools, and technology; data; and adoption (exhibit 3). six sets of practices differentiate high-performing companies from others, six sets of practices differentiate high-performing companies from others, with a subset adopted

adoption (eg, by having leaders model behaviors)1practices shown here are representative of those with the highest deltas between ai high performers and other respondents. not all practices asked about are shown.one of the most remarkable patterns we see in these findings is the adoption of core practices among companies capturing value from ai. there really is a playbook for success. it's encouraging to see a larger proportion of organizations this year doing more in foundational areas, but many still are not. we see companies, for example, still spending disproportionate time cleaning and integrating data, not following standard protocols to build ai tools, or running shiny object analyses not tied to business value.it's also striking that some of the biggest gaps between ai high performers and others aren't only in technical areas, such as using complex ai-modeling techniques, but also in the human aspects of ai, such as the alignment of senior executives around ai strategy and adoption of standard execution processes to scale ai across an organization. finally, we see a theme in these results that we see in much of our work with companies: higher performers develop or heavily customize their ai capabilities in-house. many executives now realize that ai solutions typically need to be developed or adapted in close collaboration with busi-ness users to address real business needs and enable adoption, scale, and real value creation. as a result, we see companies increasingly developing a bench of ai talent and launching training programs to raise the overall analytics acumen across their organizations.on the ground putting best practices to worksenior executives at companies making progress in ai adoption tell mckinsey in interviews that they are finding many of the leading practices essential.on strategy this program was originated bottom-up by the business, and the ceo has become a supporter, seeing this very much as a strategic opportunity. 2013

to be done with employees. our experience is that it isn't enough to train and explain.we've found it very useful to bring the associates who are experts in the applica-tion domain into the build of the solution. head of analytics and insights at a global pharmaceutical company.yet some of the less commonly considered risks are the ones in which we see increasing mitigation. national security and physical safety are more commonly addressed now than in 2019. responses also indicate that companies increasingly manage risks related to ai explainability. high performers remain more likely than others to recognize and mitigate most risks (exhibit 4). for example, respondents at high performers are 2.6 times more likely than others to say their organizations are managing equity and fairness risks such as unwanted bias in ai-driven decisions. managing ai risks while many companies still aren't acknowledging most ai risks, they modestly increased mitigating a handful of them. the survey findings suggest that a minority of companies recognize many of the risks of ai use, and fewer are working to reduce the risks as was true in 2019. cybersecurity remains the only risk that a majority of respondents say their organizations consider relevant. overall, the share of respondents citing each risk as relevant has remained flat or has decreased, with the exception of national security.a larger share of respondents than last year say their organizations are actively a larger share of respondents than last year say their organizations are actively working to mitigate risks that are not

fairness physical safety national security political stability. respondents who said don't know/not applicable are not shown.2ie, the ability to explain how ai models come to their decisions.that is, the change from the prior year was not statistically significant. it's encouraging to see the increase in recognition of risks arising from a lack of explainability, meaning the inability to understand the drivers of a complex ai model's predictions. the industry-level data show that not only are healthcare and financial services leading here, which is expected because those industries are more regulated, but also high tech and business, legal, and professional services. some of the jump in mitigation of this risk could be driven by regulations in europe and the united states (for example, the general data protection regulation [gdpr] and the california consumer privacy act [ccpa]) that affect a number of industries as well as an increased awareness of advances in explainability techniques.overall, however, the results are concerning. while some risks, such as physical safety, apply to only particular industries, it's difficult to understand why universal risks aren2019t recognized by a much higher proportion of respondents. cyber-security is relevant for any organization using any type of device connected to the internet, and attacks have risen significantly during the pandemic, which has driven even more business and commerce online. and while equity and fairness can be tricky to solve for, it should be on the list of relevant concerns for organizations in any industry. it's particularly surprising to see little improvement in the recognition and mitigation of this risk given the attention to racial bias and other examples of discriminatory treatment such as age-based targeting in job advertisements on social media.on the ground a global commodities producer increases ai adoption with explainability need to feel confident

their companies have increased investment.generally, respondents from companies that have adopted more ai capabilities are more likely to report seeing ai models misperform amid the covid-19 pandemic than others are. responses indicate that high-performing organizations, which tend to have adopted more ai capabilities than others, are witnessing more misperformance than companies seeing less value from ai. these high-performing organizations' models were particularly vulnerable within marketing and sales, product development, and service operations (exhibit 6) the areas where ai adoption is most commonly reported. the covid-19 effect despite the economic challenges that pandemic-mitigation measures have caused for many companies, those seeing the most value from ai are doubling down on the technology. the companies seeing significant value from ai are continuing to invest in it during the pandemic. most respondents at high performers say their organizations have increased investment in ai in each major business function in response to the pandemic, while less than 30 percent of other respondents say the same (exhibit 5). by industry, respondents in automotive and assembly as well as in healthcare most high-performing companies have increased their investment in ai amid most high-performing companies have increased their investment in ai amid the covid-19 crisis, though the

function.london as we all know, covid-19 has rapidly moved consumers and businesses to digital channels. throughout the pandemic, we've seen organizations across sectors adopting and scaling ai and analytics much more rapidly than they previously thought possible. many organizations have worked with their analytics teams to update demand patterns, reconsider supply chains, build scenario plans around resource needs, and enable automation in factories and other industry settings where workers may need to distance and have fewer people on-site. for example, a global pharmaceutical company linked multiple covid-19 scenarios to develop a view of supply-and-demand issues for each of their products by country and integrated that view into their regular finance- and operations-planning processes. in some cases, organizations' short-term analytics solutions weren't incredibly precise, but executives realized that they were good enough to give them more direction than they otherwise would have had.many companies are now turning to longer-term opportunities. with more data from digital channels available, improved recommender systems, for example, can enable better customer

MIT Sloan - Modern Business Models Will Drive the Post-Pandemic World (Aug-20).pdf,"In times of economic uncertainty, modern companies must applythree key components to drive growth: asecured data repository driven by Artificial Intelligencethat draws personalized product offering and valuable insights; amarketplaceof sellers and partners that meets customers needs; and asoftware-as-a-service(SaaS) product that customers and sellers see as a basic need. Organizations that combine SaaS with a marketplace platform have an edge and remain resilient during economic downturns over legacy business models. Modern business models that integrate Artificial Intelligence and machine learning increase customer loyalty by recognizing and better serving their needs.",""" in the face of a global health and economic crisis, many traditional companies have suffered tremendous losses, and some have shuttered their doors. those that heavily rely on physical capital (for example, stores, goods) and human capital (for example, services) were already vulnerable in economic downturns. the pandemic has exacerbated the lack of resilience in these business models, which have struggled to compete against digitally centric companies that can leverage data and machine learning to create valuable insights, intelligence, and capabilities across the organization. for instance, compare companies whose products are like air (customers rely on them all day long for business, personal, or financial use) with those that are like haircuts (customers use them sporadically; they are nice to have but are not critical to their needs). those in the former category that are being used constantly with little effort have proved to be resilient even in times of crisis. we typically know these as software-as-a-service (saas) products, such as salesforce for business or amazon prime for consumers. in addition, those companies that combine saas with multisided platforms (like marketplaces) to fulfill their customers2019 needs through a network of partners (such as apple's developer network) have an added advantage. these new, three-pronged models go far beyond saas and include the following: their interactions. needs. 1. a community of active b2b and b2c users that creates a network effect due to 2. a marketplace that delivers offers from sellers and suppliers to meet customers2019 3. a secured data lake powered by ai that enables customized offers and insights. we call this new winning combination a modern business model (mbm). in fact, mbms occupy four of the top 10 spots of the s&p 500's most valuable companies: apple, amazon, alphabet (google), and microsoft. and they are not alone 2014 shopify, spotify, and others have adopted this new ai-powered, subscription-based model with marketplaces. based on our own machine learning analysis of the russell 3000 index (see 201ccomparing the resilience of modern vs. legacy business models201d), we found that saas, marketplace, and modern business models have proved to be more resilient than their legacy business model counterparts in times of disruption. comparing the resilience of modern vs. legacy business models in times of disruption, modern business models prove more resilient than legacy business models based on the change in total return price. source: authors2019 analysis of the russell 3000 index while adopting a full mbm is not possible for many legacy companies (which rely on physical and human capital), saas companies are well positioned to add ai-powered data lakes and marketplaces of sellers and partners. (our team has also created an assessment model for saas companies to determine whether they have mbm potential.) and if your company is a marketplace, it may also be primed to achieve the modern status; the question you need to ask yourself is, can you create a subscription service that is critical (like air) to your buyers2019 and sellers2019 offers? by adding these key components to your growth strategy, you can begin to move from laggard to leader. product-led growth is the future of saas growth to put a fine point on the power of the 201clike air201d saas solution, product-led growth is a growth model that focuses on the product itself to drive customer acquisition, retention, and expansion. with a modern business model, companies must provide a valuable b2b or b2c software solution that becomes critical for users as they perform their daily functions. to do that, mbms use ai to generate and present data, to both business and consumer customers, that's used in combination with saas tools to create greater value. machine learning enables valuable insights that drive action for a business's ecosystem of product users. for example, one of our portfolio companies, fiix, is a cloud-based maintenance management system and emerging marketplace. ai tracks and analyzes parts and inventories and alerts users if a critical part is projected to run low, allowing the customer 2014 or even the machine 2014 to solve the issue by ordering the required part. imagine a marketplace that matches salons and clients. before this marketplace scales to critical mass, it's very easy to disrupt. however, if we add a saas solution that allows owners to keep track of operational data like appointments, payments, inventory, and client profiles, and power it with ai, the value increases. in this example, ai can facilitate personalized offers from sellers to buyers. based on their observed wants, needs, and purchase behaviors, clients are sent reminders to schedule their next appointment, and buyers receive alerts for low inventory or the need to place orders. a good example of this is mindbody, an online marketplace and ai-driven software solution for boutique gyms, salons, spas, and their clients. the private software maker, which was acquired in 2019 for $1.9 billion, has a successful mbm that is integral to a user's daily workflow. network growth is critical to ai and data generation in today's digitally centric world, increased access to people and their data have made offer personalization possible, and even expected by users. business and consumer customers want to feel especially important, regardless of how fast your company is growing. however, many organizations focus on themselves 2014 their internal processes, people, and products 2014 and spend little time or effort on customer engagement and loyalty other than social media likes. profitable growth begins with creating more promoters and fewer detractors. mbms use ai and machine learning to increase customer loyalty by recognizing and serving the needs of customers with an almost human-level degree of understanding and personalization 2014 or empathy at scale. given that empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person, our belief is that ai, when used with care and compassion, enables companies that are data-, machine-, and network-centric to begin understanding the feelings of their customers and suppliers. it even enables the sharing of those feelings among their network participants so that their partners can meet their needs with offers of goods and services. an example of this is dignifi, which uses machine learning and data to match consumers who need car repair financing with lenders that want to reach those consumers with myriad offers. in the marketplace environment, this means better matching to users2019 needs and creating a tailored experience, by surfacing the information and features that are most relevant to them. the value scales with each additional participant, which drives community development and growth. as more matches take place, the data and insights expand in exponential fashion, leading to improved user experience, more features, and more value. this growth attracts more users, which continues the flywheel cycle of more data to improve the community experience. as the network grows, it becomes harder for community members to leave for a competitor, especially if this is where everyone is. eventually, the marketplace grows to an impassable data lake 2014 competitors in the industry will struggle to cross it. in this way, ai is an essential component for mbm businesses to foster customer empathy and create supplier value on an unprecedented scale. what gives mbms absolute advantage over traditional and saas business models is that mbms actually become stronger as they get bigger. ai and machine learning allow mbms to see greater returns instead of the decreasing value of investment that many companies see as they expand. failing to prepare is preparing to fail you2019ve probably heard the classic advice to start with the end in mind. another way of saying it: failing to prepare your business for success in today's modern environment is preparing to fail. there are three factors of success in a pre- and post-covid-19 world: 1. a data- and ai-centric strategy that drives insights from every interaction and helps match customers2019 wants and needs with suppliers2019 products and services at scale. 2. a saas product that is as critical as air, providing a reason for both customers and suppliers to interact with your company all the time. 3. a marketplace that goes far beyond your own offers, in which your sellers and partners meet each and every need of your customers. companies that neglect these three critical ingredients will mistakenly think that somehow the products and services they market, make, and sell will suffice in a world in which customers can get whatever they want, wherever they want it, from whomever they want it. to remain relevant and resilient, companies and leaders must strive to build business models in a way that ensures that these three components are working together: ai that enables and powers a centralized data lake of enterprise data, a marketplace of sellers and partners that make individualized offers based on the intelligence of the data collected and powered by ai, and a saas platform that is essential for users. about the authors lanham napier (@lnapier) was the

PwC - 5G Rollout Delays in Europe (Jul-20).pdf,"PwC estimates deployment of Europes 5G mobile networks will be delayed 12-18 months, and telcos will struggle to achieve ROI targets the longer they delay rolling out services, as a result of the current global crisis. Analysis from the 2008 economic downturn suggests that European network operators will reduce CapEx by 6B-9B over the next two years. While 5G will remain a near-term priority, blue sky 5G applications like ubiquitous connectivity for autonomous vehicles will be put on hold. In countries that have not yet sold 5G licenses, the pace of rollouts is expected to slow significantly as operators may be reluctant to make major investments in new spectrum.",""" Countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout executive summary so far, the covid-19 pandemic has had little adverse impact on tele-communications companies (telcos). on the contrary, with a surge in home-working and digitization, communication capacity and quality requirements have increased, making telcos even more critical to our economy and society. however, going forward, the global economic crisis resulting from the pandemic will have a significant impact on the ability of telcos to invest in rolling out 5g mobile networks. Using the experience of European telcos during the financial crisis of 2008-09, we have modelled the likely effects of the current downturn on their investment spending. following the 2008 crisis, European telcos saw their revenues fall over two years. this revenue decline translated into a significantly larger drop in investment spending that fell particularly hard on mobile networks and its capital expenditure (capex). Applying our findings to the current situation leads us to some major projections:2022 European telcos’ investment spending over the next two years will fall by 206bn-209 bn 2022 rollout of 5g mobile networks will be delayed by 12 to 18 months2022 capex budgets will come under additional pressure as telcos invest to accommodate changing patterns of demand for network capacity, caused notably by increased home-working and reduced commuting2022 a carefully considered response from operators, suppliers and regulators will be needed to respond to covid-19 impacts a result, telcos need to act urgently to address the squeeze on their 5g investment plans. specifically, they must review their 5g business cases and deployment timetables, given the significant growth and changing pattern of demand for network capacity that has emerged due to the covid-19 lockdown. we expect a reprioritization of capex plans across all areas of the business to secure sufficient funding, to continue investing in 5g and to partially mitigate the risks of delaying deployment, while at the same time coping with increasing demands on their fixed infrastructure. this will involve tough choices: a complete review of capex plans, a drive to achieve further capex efficiencies and delays to selected transformation projects in other areas. Countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout delays in 5g deployment carry serious risks and costs for telcos, many of which own time-limited 5g spectrum licenses and will struggle to achieve their return on investment (ROI) targets the longer they delay rolling out services. operators’ original business cases also depended on delivering not only faster versions of services available today, but also entirely new applications to support the internet of things (iot) and autonomous vehicles, for example. unless these can be delivered, the business case for 5g will be compromised. delays in 5g investments also pose serious risks for equipment vendors whose sales for the next two years may be jeopardized. finally, regulators also face challenges because their plans to develop the digital economy depend heavily on the telcos’ ability to deliver nationwide 5g connectivity. we conclude this report with a series of detailed recommendations for telcos, equipment vendors and regulators to help them minimize the risks of a prolonged squeeze on telcos’ investment capacity resulting from the covid-19 crisis. the economic downturn following the covid-19 crisis may delay telecom operator investments in 5g in Europe by 12 to 18 months. Countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout outlook: the covid-19 crisis will reduce telco revenues for the next two years usually, the telecoms sector is relatively resilient in times of economic crisis, partly due to its largely contracted revenue model. however, our modelling suggests that the covid-19 induced recession across western European markets is likely to cause telcos’ revenues to decline over the next two years, after which we expect a recovery (see exhibit 1). our base case forecasts a drop of 2-3 percent in the sector’s revenues for 2020 and a further 1-2 percent decline in 2021, before recovery begins during 2022. the key factors driving the decline will be defaults and late payments among consumers and business customers, as well as users downgrading to cheaper subscription packages or renegotiating their contracts with existing suppliers. in addition, telco revenues that depend upon investment programs by business customers 2013 installing workspace management systems or new it tooling, for example 2013 will be hit as many such investment projects have been paused or cancelled. countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout the revenue implications for capex budgets will be significant, particularly for 5g investments telcos typically reinvest 15-16 percent of their revenues in infrastructure every year to fund technology upgrades and additional capacity. any drop in revenue, therefore, will inevitably have a material impact on their ability to sustain the pace of investment. we expect companies to seek, at best, to maintain their capex intensity as a percentage of their reduced revenues, and in many cases, we expect them to reduce capex below that level, in light of the economic conditions. the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis provides a useful framework to understand the likely effects of the covid-19 pandemic on telcos’ investment plans. although the technology context was different, there were some parallels with the situation today: when the 2008 crisis struck, telcos were investing in 4g and vdsl, transformation projects for their core networks and its systems, as well as selective innovations. following the crisis, European telecom revenues declined by 4.7 percent in 2009 from their pre-crisis levels before increasing by 3 percent in 2010. this resulted in a V-shaped dip with revenues in 2010 returning to the pre-crisis trendline. however, this revenue decline led to a much larger reduction in capex among European telcos. our data show that operators were relatively slow to reduce capex initially because when the financial crisis broke, they had already committed a large proportion of their capex budgets. however, in 2009 they cut capex investments by an average of 13 percent and continued to hold down capex for two years. by 2011, European operators’ capex was still 4 percent lower than its level in 2007, before the crisis, although at this level it represented a similar level of investment intensity, expressed as a percentage of their revenues (see exhibit 2). this pattern highlights two key conclusions: 2022 for telcos, capex investment is significantly less resilient than revenues2022 the impact on capital budgets of any decline in revenues lags by approximately 6-12 months, starting later and continuing for a time after revenues begin to grow again. if the revenue decline is V-shaped, the knock-on effect on capex is more u-shaped. Exhibit 2capex spend, europe100%97%87%90%96%20072008200920102011source: strategy& analysis4strategy& | countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout the major capex impacts will be on mobile networks and it projects we can also use the 2008 crisis to examine how cuts in capex were distributed across different areas. European telcos made the biggest cuts in areas dominated by large, discrete projects that were easier to delay or cancel:2022 its investments fell by 20-25 percent as transformation projects were halted. investment in this area did not return to pre-crisis levels.2022 mobile network investments fell 20 percent as deployment projects were delayed. this capex reduction took place against a background of increasing network usage that necessarily required investments in additional capacity. 2022 fixed and core network investments were relatively protected, declining by 6 percent against the pre-crisis trendline. this is mainly because a large proportion of this spending comprises essential replacements and upgrades to maintain services. the main delays were in projects to deploy fiber and vdsl. 2022 customer-driven capex fell 10 percent mainly due to lower spending on customer acquisition in the consumer segment and delayed investments in the b2b segment. customer capex increased after three years as postponed investments in handset replacements and upgrades were carried out. we expect delays in 5g rollouts to result in fewer new handsets being sold and consumers seeking to spend less on 5g handsets, which will have a negative impact on handset manufacturers (see exhibit 3). Countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout the read-across from 2008 2013 capex to fall 20ac6bn-20ac9bnin today’s context, it is important to note that although the technologies in question have changed since 2008, the split of capex across these major investment categories has not shifted significantly. our analysis from the previous crisis therefore reinforces our view that we will see very deep cuts in investment by European telcos over the next two years, and that once again these will be concentrated on it upgrades and mobile networks (see exhibit 4). exhibit 4europe capex split ‘18,0%16,2%14,9%21,3%29,6%customer driven core and replacement fixed access/airmobile/5gitsource: strategy& analysis applying the model developed on the basis of the previous crisis to the situation today, we forecast that a 2-3 percent decrease in revenues against the pre-crisis trendline for 2020 is likely to result in a decline in capex of 9 percent in 2021. with revenues forecast to decline 1-2 percent in 2021, we expect the squeeze on capex to continue in 2022, leaving it 8 percent below its pre-crisis trendline. we do not therefore expect to see capex return to pre-crisis trend levels until 2023 (see exhibit 5). the declines in capex that we predict would represent a reduction in investment spending across Europe of between 206 bn and 209 bn over the next two years. leading up to the pandemic, European operators had spent several years preparing to launch the next generation of mobile communications. given our prediction that a large proportion of these capex cuts will impact mobile investments, and particularly 5g deployments, we expect investments in mobile networks to be delayed by between 12 and 18 months. for telecoms operators that plan for a technology cycle of six to seven years, a delay of more than a year is significant and calls their pre-covid-19 roadmaps for 5g deployment into question. 5g deployment plans depend on major investments in networks, as well as large investments by corporate users of these networks to develop new use cases. much of this spending now faces delays. investments in innovative platforms and service development, meanwhile, could be paused indefinitely, pushing many of the advanced applications of 5g technology, such as many iotas use cases, further into the future. How covid-19 is reshaping demand for telco services with covid-19 much has changed and we see significant issues on the demand side across all major areas of the telcos’ operations 2013 fixed, mobile and wholesale networks 2013 that will challenge their existing 5g rollout plans. demand has both surged and shifted since widespread lockdowns came into force around the world, broadband video consumption has surged. Netflix reported the biggest quarterly jump in subscribers in its 13-year history, while it is reported that Netflix and YouTube have reduced streaming quality in Europe temporarily to ease the strain on networks. at the same time, video conferencing has reached the mass market. during march, zoom passed 200m users a day.1 during April, it passed 300m.2 online gaming traffic has doubled on mobile and almost trebled on fixed broadband. telia carrier, for example, has reported changes in video conferencing traffic of more than 400 percent at certain times (see exhibit 6, next page)3. this level of growth has major impacts on fixed, mobile and wholesale networks: 2022 fixed networks: streaming traffic on fixed broadband has increased 50 percent across European networks, operators report. telef00f3nica’s fixed data traffic spiked 35 percent over a month, surpassing the 30 percent growth it had registered over the previous year4. online education and home-working accounted for most of the jump, according to telef00f3nica2022 mobile networks: operators report that streaming traffic on mobile networks has increased 40 percent since the start of the covid-19 crisis, according to European telcos. Vodafone says mobile data usage has increased around 15 percent across Europe in recent weeks, peaking at 30 percent in Spain and italy.52022 wholesale networks: telia carrier said traffic volumes had gone up more than 50 percent during the covid-19 crisis. on average, points-of-presence (pops), where an operator connects to its network, have grown 20.5 percent, with a peak of 208 percent growth 23 march 2020% change data from telcos demonstrates that many of these effects were global, with similar shifts in usage appearing in geographically diverse markets. for example, alongside the increase in mobile data traffic, Vodafone said fixed broadband usage had also gone up more than 50 percent in Italy and Spain alone, two of the first European countries to introduce lockdowns. weekly data on upstream traffic on one of Vodafone’s European fixed broadband networks illustrates the surge in demand caused by the introduction of home-working and social distancing measures. the red line represents the week before the restrictions came into effect, the other two lines are for the two subsequent weeks (see exhibit 7). Countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout shifting demand has big implications for the supply/network side operators are reacting to pressures both from the consumer side and from the network side. in the UK, operators such as virgin mobile have responded to the increase in demand for connectivity by giving away gbs of mobile data, scrapping low usage caps, providing extra tv channels and upgrading network speed. in turkey, operators have offered free data to allow customers to connect to the ministry of education’s online education services. from a network perspective, companies are struggling to upgrade their corporate network infrastructure to support home-working, while fixed and wholesale network operators are investing heavily to ensure network resilience and avoid failures. telia carrier, for example, added capacity on its core network backbone at a significantly higher rate during march, compared with the previous five months (see exhibit 8). exhibit 8monthly backbone buildouts. ‘19nov. ‘19dec. ‘19jan. ‘20feb. ‘20mar. ‘20source: telia carrier, strategy& analysis however, not only must operators react to significantly higher demand for network capacity. they must also navigate the new location complexity that is emerging, now that people are increasingly working from home and travelling much less. this shifts the overall traffic burden towards residential areas and tends also to move it from mobile to fixed networks. this poses challenges for networks that were built on the basis of previous patterns of consumption, which assumed 60 percent of usage would be in the workplace. naturally, this forces operators to revisit their capex planning and to address the question of whether and how far these changes in the pattern of demand will prove permanent. although we expect data traffic to return to more normal patterns in the months to come, as lock-downs end and people slowly return to work, we believe there will be a long-term shift towards home-working and therefore less commuter travel. this will result in changes in traffic towards residential locations and therefore a sustained increase in demand for fixed network capacity countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout operators will also have to factor in potential changes in their supply chains as they try to reduce single-country risk and ensure diversity of supply. this shift will come at a cost. telcos may be forced to source via higher-cost, western suppliers instead of lower-cost Chinese competitors. we calculate that this translates into a 15-20 percent cost increase, which is equivalent to 2-3 percent drain on their available capex capacity. Actions to take with 5g rollouts at risk: key steps for operators, vendors and regulators the covid-19 crisis is highly likely to lead to a marked slowdown in investment by European telcos over the next two years, particularly in mobile networks. this will have major implications for the rollout of 5g services. there is no doubt that 5g will remain the near-term technology priority for telcos, however we believe the business cases that telcos have previously adopted will have to be revised. more 2018blue sky’ applications that depend on 5g, such as dense networks of micro-cells to provide ubiquitous connectivity for autonomous vehicles, are likely to be put on hold. equally, in countries that have not yet sold 5g licenses, operators may be reluctant to make major investments in new spectrum under the current conditions. we therefore expect the pace of rollouts in these countries to slow significantly. in order to preserve sufficient headroom to invest in 5g roll-outs, operators should undertake a major rethink of their capex allocations across all areas of their business and further improve their management of capex to realize efficiency gains. at the same time, suppliers need to reconsider their production and investment plans to cope with slowing 5g investments. regulators meanwhile, will want to ensure continuity in investment and digitalization. 10strategy& | countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout implications for operators 2013 reprioritize capex spend1 operators need to revisit their pre-covid-19 business cases for 5g and their roll-out plans, to address several critical issues: 2022 what impact will the covid-19 economic crisis have on revenues, and how far will this reduce available capex? what lessons can be drawn from the previous crisis to answer these questions?2022 what impact will the shift in demand for connectivity caused by increased home-working and reduced commuting and leisure travel have on the existing businesses: fixed and mobile broadband and wholesale (national and international)? 2022 how should 5g investment and roll-out plans change to reflect the shift in demand for capacity and location? which spectrum (900mhz vs 2.6ghz, for example) and which technology (fixed vs mobile networks) will be most suitable for new patterns of usage created by more home-working, less commuting into city-centers and therefore a more dispersed set of users in suburban and rural locations? how much of the current shift of usage towards residential areas is expected to persist in the long term? 23operators should reassess and reprioritize their overall capex budget to secure the funding required to implement their amended 5g roll-out plans and so partially mitigate the risks from delay in 5g. operators should focus on strategies to achieve more cost-effective network deployment:2022 they should explore sharing network base stations with other operators (particularly in rural areas where build costs are higher and usage is lower), as well as spectrum-sharing, where this is permitted2022 where possible, they should bring forward the decommissioning of legacy technologies (2g, 3g, analog tv channels etc.) so that the spectrum can be redistributed and redeployed for use with 5g or to provide increased capacity for 4g.2022 they should consider the financial and operational benefits of joint ventures to enable sharing of fiber networks, or a carve-out of their fiber backbone into a separate company (as has been mooted for but Openreach). 2022 they need to review their vendor strategy and de-risk their supply chain to reduce cost and deployment risks. 11strategy& | countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout vendors that have budgeted for significant 5g investments by operators need to consider how to incentivize and accelerate equipment sales to counter any slowdown in rollouts. measures could include commercial rebates or alternative charging models. Implications for equipment vendors 2013 coping with 5g slowdowns 123vendors should examine ways, including standardization and automation, to reduce the costs of deploying 5g equipment and protect their margins. areas of focus in the search for greater efficiency should include their transportation, installation and administration costs. Vendors should assess the impact on supply chains of problems in producing and exporting equipment from countries facing disruption, notably china. delays in 5g investments will affect both consumers and business customers, but also public authorities and equipment vendors201d.12strategy& | countering the threat to Europe’s 5g rollout implications for regulators 2013 secure continued and rapid deployment of 5g1 regulators should do everything possible to reduce risks to the development of the digital economy from any slowdown in the rollout of 5g. if telcos are forced to delay deployment, developments such as sensor-based iot applications, and in the longer term autonomous vehicles, will be threatened along with the wide range of companies making and using these systems. regulators can safeguard against this threat by helping operators to maximize their available capex. options include revising price expectations for spectrum licenses as well as the payment timetable. 2regulators should also consider extending the deadlines to achieve set levels of coverage that are built into licenses, and should review which types of coverage are to be prioritized 2013 business districts vs rural areas, for example 2013 and consider incentivizing operators to rethink their deployment plans and bring them into line with the new regulatory priorities. 34the economic slowdown caused by covid-19 and resulting delays in 5g deployments will inevitably extend the technology cycle beyond the typical five-to-seven years that the telco industry had originally assumed. this creates serious risks and costs for operators, putting roe targets in jeopardy and compromising the business case which anticipated 5g’s rollout in support of new iot applications. However, delays also bring material downsides for many other stakeholders. equipment vendors face obvious challenges, along with the wide range of innovative companies planning and building services that depend on 5g connectivity. ultimately, governments seeking to develop the digital economy and ensure their countries’ future economic competitiveness will see their agenda challenged by the likely slowdown in the transition to 5g. for all these groups, there is a pressing need to revisit pre-covid-19 investment plans and assumptions and adapt to the new conditions the pandemic will leave behind. Regulators should examine how to support deployments into the remotest rural areas, for example by allowing collaboration between operators, investments by municipalities or by providing targeted funding to support rollouts. Regulators should reconsider existing spectrum allocations, as the US FCC did as part of the keep Americans connected initiative during the covid-19 crisis. this allowed operators to use additional spectrum to meet increasing broadband demand.

However, the willingness to pay for integrated connected car services is low, with China leading at only 58% willingness to pay an extra surcharge for integrated CVS. PwC recommends that winning consumers in other categories will require a strong USP and compelling story. Capturing value from CVS will require providers to compete partially against other digital services."," slashdata is the leading analyst company in the developer economy, tracking global software developer trends based on more than 30,000 software developers annually in over 160 countries. our surveys track the changing landscape of mobile, iot, desktop, cloud, web, ar, vr, games, machine learning developers, and data scientists. our mantra: we help the world understand developers -and developers understand the world. developer economics is a global community engaging thousands of developers of all shapes and sizes across the globe, enabling them to benchmark themselves against the developer nation. we are committed to facilitating community contribution and knowledge sharing, and promoting diversity and inclusion in the developer ecosystem. our vision is to empower developers to shape the future developers extra needs due to covid-19: working and performing during a pandemic will leave deep marks behind, both financially and psychologically speaking. in this chapter, we explore covid-19's effects on developers changing needs in relation to their development activities. language communities - an update: programming languages are often the kernels of strong communities and the subject of opinionated debate. in this chapter, we provide updated estimates of the number of active software developers using each of the major programming languages, across the globe and across all kinds of programmers. why do developers adopt or reject cloud technologies? in a world where infrastructure can be provisioned and destroyed at will, and where data and server configurations can be transferred easily between homogeneous systems, cloud providers have to find other areas of differentiation in order to compete. vendor lock-in is much less of an issue for users than it once was, and the rise of the developer as a decision-maker has put even more power into their hands. in this chapter, we look at some of the reasons that developers give for adopting or rejecting different cloud technologies and provide insight into why things are as they are. who is into devops? devops is commonly used as a catch-all term to describe a cultural shift within organizations that enables developers to release software faster and more reliably. however, devops is not a single, coherent sector or technology, which often creates confusion as to who is considered a devops practitioner. in this chapter, we offer a fresh view on who is into devops based on the activities developers are involved in. we also look at the specific roles and software sectors that are most associated with the devops culture. what do developers’ value in open source? based on our research, the use of open-source software (oss) is ubiquitous in the global developer community. in this chapter, we explore what exactly developers’ value in using oss. we also highlight some uncertainties around the future of the open-source movement by presenting trends across geographic regions and software sectors. Emerging technologies: as interest in a technology waxes and wanes, so does its influence. the hot topic of yesterday becomes insignificant in the face of new challenges and opportunities. in our surveys, we have tracked engagement with and adoption of emerging technologies for the past two and a half years. Developers extra needs due to covid-19 four in ten developers report that they need more flexibility in working hours/workload as a consequence of covid-19.  collaboration tools and platforms are the most important technical need for developers.  self-employed developers and developers who work for small companies have fewer extra needs due to covid-19.  the larger the company developers work for, the stronger their need for self-management and collaboration tools, as well as for mental health support.  developers responsible for tooling specifications and for approving budgets and expenses are in the greatest need of increased security, performance, and cloud space. Who is into devops?  the vast majority of professional developers (more than 80%) are involved in devops in one way or another.  continuous integration (ci) and continuous deployment (cd) are two of the most common devops practices, but only one in four developers use both to fully automate their workflow.  programmers are very likely to use ci/cd, but not so much operational practices such as monitoring applications in production environments.  with some exceptions, software sectors with high concentrations of experienced professionals are more likely to embrace the devops model. Programming language communities 2013 an update javascript is the most popular programming language by a wide margin, with 12.4m developers globally using it.  python now counts 9m users, after adding 2.2m net new developers in the past year alone, outranking java at the beginning 2020.  kotlin is one of the fastest growing language communities, having increased more than two-fold in size since the end 2017.what do developers’ value in open source?  developers appreciate collaborating and interacting with the open-source community more than contributing to open-source projects.  western European developers value almost every aspect of open source more than developers in other regions.  south Asian developers highly value contributing to open-source projects, positioning this region to drive the next wave of open-source development. Why do developers adopt or reject cloud technologies?  pricing and support/documentation dominate developers decision-making process when adopting a cloud technology, but pricing is by far the most important reason for rejection.  there are lots of opportunities for vendors to differentiate their orchestration tools in the market - developers are less concerned with price and more with features that help them to develop.  developers aren’t so concerned with feature set or performance - as long as cloud solutions meet minimum requirements.  developers will reject technologies that don’t provide them with a fulfilling development experience. having access to a community and adequate support are important. Emerging technologies emerging technologies such as ar and vr are not fully engaging oss principles.  little change in engagement and adoption rates indicate that devops has reached maturity.  fog/edge computing is gaining traction amongst developers engaged with the topic, but overall engagement is low.  computer vision is on the path to maturity, and with a strong pipeline of developers learning about this topic, adoption will continue to rise.  fatigue is setting in for some advanced technologies, but adoption is rising amongst developers who continue to engage. Working and performing during a pandemic will developers extra needs due to covid-19leave deep marks behind, both financially and psychologically speaking. in this chapter, we explore covid-19's effects on developers changing needs in relation to their development activities. there have been more than 30 million covid-19 cases around the world, with 7.3 million of those still active. the virus is ubiquitous and affects all continents to more or less similar degrees. working and performing during a pandemic is an experience that will undoubtedly leave deep marks behind, both financially and psychologically speaking. in this edition of our state of the developer nation report, we explore covid-19's effects on developers changing needs in relation to their development activities. 73% of developers reported having additional needs due to covid-19. in particular, 34%, or 7.2 million developers, expressed their need for flexible working hours/workload. quarantine and social distancing policies have encouraged many employers to allow their workers to work from home, where possible. a large proportion of workers are now facing the inconvenience of relocating their working space into their home. among such inconveniences is the necessity of taking care of households while keeping up productivity. under these circumstances, flexibility is seen as the key to success, or simply survival. the next most common perceived needs, reported by about one in four developers, are: collaboration tools and platforms (26%), online training resources (25%), and virtual opportunities to support networking and peer-to-peer interaction (23%). among these three, the only technical one, strictly speaking, refers to the need for collaboration tools, such as video conferencing platforms. the other top needs are related to self-improvement and self-management, and to socializing. the supremacy of non-technical needs is striking. all of the technical necessities, except collaboration tools, sit at the bottom of the list, being reported only by about one in ten developers: better performance in terms of computing resources (13%), hardware components (9%), increased security (9%), and additional cloud space (7%). there are two explanations for these patterns. first, developers may have not indicated the need for extra technical support because it had been already fulfilled, i.e., their employers had already provided them with it. it could also be, however, that developers did not perceive technical considerations as being more important than flexibility, networking, and learning. the bigger the company, the more flexibility is needed% of developers, we ran a random forest model and found that the most important factor in influencing developers needs in relation to covid-19 is their company size. compared to those in middle- or large-sized companies, self-employed developers and developers working in small businesses of up to 20 employees report fewer new needs overall. that is especially the case for flexibility in terms of working hours/workload, and for collaboration tools. the most probable explanation is that they would have already implemented a flexible working schedule prior to covid-19. this is likely to apply to contractors as well as to small, dynamic startups. when it comes to keeping collaboration and interaction going, it may just be easier for small groups of people to maintain old habits or find an easy-to-use tool, such as emailing, phoning, or even getting together whilst respecting the required social distancing. the bigger the company, the stronger the need for all of the above, including opportunities for virtual interactions. a large company typically requires a structured system of communication, and usually that system needs to accommodate the various teams' diverse needs; even more so when a company is locked into an its vendor's services. Interestingly, the need for mental health support also linearly increases with company size, probably as a result of those challenges experienced in terms of flexibility and peer-to-peer communication and interaction. another potential reason is that employees in larger organizations, where nobody is indispensable by default, may be experiencing more performance pressure and be more scared of losing their jobs. While developers’ technical needs due to covid-19 do not change significantly with company size, they strongly correlate to the developer’s level of involvement in tool purchasing decisions. those most concerned about increased security, performance, and cloud space are the ones responsible for tool specs and expenses, as well as budget approval, who usually fulfill roles within technical management. On the one hand, with the increasing number of developers working from home, more machines need to be available and connected via vpn and similar technologies. more layers to navigate introduces complexity barriers that affect work efficiency, but also the need for the implementation of extra security controls. furthermore, servers are often overloaded and downtimes happen more frequently, affecting system reliability. if you add to this the fact that budgets are being reduced or even frozen, due to the economic instability the pandemic is causing, the situation is actually precarious. those in charge are inevitably the ones noticing the need for technical support the most.in a relatively short time, the pandemic has generated and consolidated a series of working practices that had been previously known only to a very small proportion of the population. such new practices, based on remote working and virtual collaboration, are likely to persist after covid-19. if one acknowledges this, investing in optimizing support becomes even more valuable. we recommend that, especially large enterprises, consider the delicate balance between self-management and collaboration needs when designing policies and offering support to their employees in the face of the pandemic situation. it can be hard to assess how widely used a programming language is. the indices available from players like tiobe, redmonk, stack overflow's yearly survey, or github's octoverse are great, but offer mostly relative comparisons between languages, providing no sense of the absolute size of each community. they may also be biased geographically, or skewed towards certain fields of software development or open-source developers. Size of programming language communities in q3 2020 active software developers, globally, in millions we present here look at active software developers using each programming language; across the globe and across all kinds of programmers. they are based on two pieces of data. first, our independent estimate of the global number of software developers, which we published for the first time in 2017. we estimate that in mid-2020 there were 21.3m active software developers in the world. second, our large-scale, low-bias surveys which reach tens of thousands of developers every six months. in the surveys, we consistently ask developers about their use of programming languages across ten areas of development, giving us rich and reliable information about who uses each language and in which context. Nearly 5m developers joined the javascript community in the last three years JavaScript is the most popular programming language by a wide margin, with 12.4m developers globally using it. notably, the javascript community has been growing in size consistently for the past three years. between q2 2017 and q3 2020, nearly 5m developers joined the community - by far the highest growth in absolute terms across all languages. even in software sectors where javascript is least popular, like data science or ar/vr, over a fifth of developers use it in their projects. For the second half-year period in a row, python is the most widely adopted language behind javascript. python now counts 9m users, after adding 2.2m net new developers in the past year alone, outranking java at the beginning of 2020. the rise of data science and machine learning (ml) is a clear factor in its popularity. an impressive 77% of ml developers and data scientists currently use python. for perspective, only 22% user, the other language often associated with data science.java, with over 8m active users worldwide, is the cornerstone of the mobile app ecosystem - android - as well as one of the most important general-purpose languages. its adoption may have remained stable in the past six months but, in the overall picture, the java community has gained 1.6m developers since mid-2017, which corresponds to a 24% the group of major, well-established languages is completed with c/c++ (6.3m), php (6.1m) and c# (6m). the fact that c# lost three places in the ranking of language communities during the last three years is mostly explained by its slower growth compared to c/c++ and php. c and c++ remain core languages in iot projects (for both on-device and application-level coding), whereas php is still the second most commonly used language in web applications, after javascript. on the other hand, c# may be sustaining its dominance in the game and ar/vr developer ecosystems, but it seems to be losing its edge in desktop development - possibly due to the emergence of cross-platform tools based on web technologies’# is growing in popularity, but at a slower pace than php and c/c++as we had found in previous editions of this report too, kotlin is one of the fastest growing language communities, having increased more than two-fold in size since the end of 2017, from 1.1m in q4 2017 to 2.3m in q3 2020. this is also very evident from kotlin's ranking, where it moved from 11th to ninth place during that period - a trend that's largely attributed to google's decision to make kotlin its preferred language for android development. Swift surpassed kotlin in popularity this year, after attracting slightly more net new developers in the first half of 2020 (400k vs 300k). since swift became the default language for development across all apple platforms, the adoption of objective c has been decreasing steadily. this phase-out from the apple app ecosystem is also matched by a significant drop in the rank of objective c, from ninth to 12th place. Finally, the more niche languages - go, ruby, rust, and lua - are still much smaller, with up to 1.5m active software developers each. ruby and lua have been around for more than two decades now, but their communities have essentially stopped growing in the last three years. on the contrary, go and rust appear to be actively adding developers, although it is still unclear whether the two languages will climb the programming language ranking in the coming period.

pandemic than to the beginning, focusing on thriving in the future rather than responding to the present.across multiple parts of the technology, media, and telecom (tmt) ecosystem, observers have been repeating some version of the comment, 201cthere have been five years of change in five months due to the pandemic.201d covid-19 has been a catalyst2014an unwelcome one, but still a catalyst2014for needed changes across the tmt landscape.a catalyst is a substance that causes a chemical reaction to occur more rapidly than it would have without. sometimes, only a tiny amount of catalyst can trigger a significant change. in the same way, the sars-cov-2 virus, which is only 100 nanometers across and weighs one trillionth of a milligram, has catalyzed considerable changes in many facets of tmt. some of these changes happened extremely quickly. movements to the cloud, to video visits for medicine, and to the intelligent edge were already underway in 2019, but they have been accelerated by years or even decades because of the pandemic. we expect rapid evolution in these three areas to continue through 2021.other parts of the tmt industry were also shaped by the pandemic, although not to the same extent. the future of women's sports may be imperiled by restrictions on gatherings. upgrades to 8k tvs may be accelerated by lockdowns and the rise in time spent

edgeedge computing and intelligence could propel tech and telecom growthchris arkenberg, ariane bucaille, sanket nesargi, dan littmann, and jeff loucksrising from decades of instrumentation, automation, and connectivity, the intelligent edge is maturing into a revolutionary set of capabilities that are already transforming some of the largest technology and communications companies on the planet. although market estimates vary considerably,1 deloitte predicts that in 2021, the global market for the intelligent edge will expand to us$12 billion, continuing a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of around 35%.2 expansion in 2021 will be driven primarily by telecoms deploying the intelligent edge for 5g networks, and by hyperscale cloud providers optimizing their infrastructure and service offerings. these highly capitalized leaders are establishing the use cases and best practices that may make it easier for companies across multiple industries to attain the capabilities of the intelligent edge. by 2023, 70% of enterprises may likely run some amount of data processing at the edge.3 as one leading graphics processing unit (gpu) manufacturer has stated, 201cwe2019re about to enter a phase where we2019re going to create an internet that is thousands of times bigger than the internet that we enjoy today.201d4the potential for faster, less expensive, and more secure operations in everything from autonomous vehicles to virtual reality to the internet of things (iot)2014helping to accelerate the fourth industrial revolution.5what is the intelligent edge?the intelligent edge is the combination of advanced connectivity, compact processing power, and artificial intelligence (ai) located near devices that use and generate data.6 it represents an evolution and convergence of trends in industrial monitoring, automated manufacturing, utility management, and telecommunications, amplified by cloud computing, data analytics, and ai. the intelligent edge puts these latter capabilities physically near where data needs rapid analysis and response, enabling that data to be acted on directly or filtered to push only the most important bits to the core. in particular, the intelligent edge's ability to bring cloud capabilities to remote operations could greatly amplify their performance.though challenges and headwinds exist, we believe that the intelligent edge is poised to transform the computing landscape, propelling the world's largest technology companies toward the next generation of connectivity and operational efficiency. by bringing powerful computing capabilities closer to where data originates and needs to be consumed, the intelligent edge unlocks the monumental rise of ai and the evolution of computation to support it are critical enablers, driving tectonic shifts in the semiconductor industry.7 graphics processing units (gpus) have been moving into data centers to support ai workloads and dedicated ai chips are reaching out to the edges, including devices, to operate on incoming data immediately.8 advanced connectivity ties them all together, while virtualization enables services to seamlessly run 5gaining an intelligent edge: edge computing and intelligence could propel tech and telecom growthacross a web of diverse and dynamic components, from the cloud to the edge. indeed, effective planning and implementation of an intelligent edge strategy may require coordination and orchestration of multiple ecosystem providers. the monumental rise of ai and the evolution of computation to support it are critical enablers, driving tectonic shifts in the semiconductor industry.this rise of the intelligent edge will likely drive the evolution of service architectures to become more location-driven, decentralized, and distributed. the intelligent edge does not replace the cloud or data centers but, rather, is an element within a holistic cloud-to-edge architecture.9 some components of a service will run in a centralized cloud, others at the data center, and more yet at the edges on sensor arrays, autonomous vehicles, and potentially billions of machine endpoints. the ways that computation operates on different parts of the data journey, where it operates, and the differing requirements those operations place on connectivity and speed may reshape how services are architected by distributing components based on their needs. there are challenges to overcome, however. standards and best practices have yet to cohere, and issues with interoperability and security will likely become more visible. the intelligent edge today combines solutions from telecoms, hyperscalers, and technology providers, and effective implementation requires coordination and integration across multiple sectors. who owns which pieces? who makes the most of their capabilities? who will deliver the best end-to-end solutions for the rest of the market? the answers to these questions could shape the landscape for years. why is the intelligent edge important?for businesses with data-driven use cases, the intelligent edge can offer the following key capabilities:102022 more efficient use of bandwidth and greater network visibility, which can lower costs2022 resilience against poor, unreliable, and lost connectivity due to lower dependency on wide area networks (wans) 2022 more control over data triage, normalization, residency, and privacy through the ability to keep more data local rather than needing to transmit it across the network to the core2022 support for low-latency use cases and fast response times2022 greater automation and autonomywith these capabilities, the intelligent edge can add greater visibility across operations, support faster data analysis and real-time response, and enable better automation and more dynamic systems. if certain microservices require very low latency and high security, such as facial recognition for facility access, they can execute at the edge rather than in the cloud. this can enable much tighter decision loops, reducing the costs and security risks of network transit: the edge can send the most important bits to the core and the core can manage the edge. the intelligent edge can support large-scale transformational solutions that could radically evolve manufacturing, logistics, robotics, mobility, and consumer electronics.11 for instance, an 6technology, media, and telecommunications predictions 2021intelligent edge system can shift supply chains from somewhat fragile, linear systems to more programmable, responsive, and adaptive digital networks, which are able to reshape themselves to address changing demands and disruptions.12 as another example, utilities and similar organizations could use the intelligent edge to connect ai-enabled drones to address mounting risks posed by aging infrastructure,13 which could make identifying and addressing those risks much faster. one norwegian oil rig has already deployed a remote autonomous robotic dog that can patrol the rig and visually inspect for issues such as gas leaks.14 these devices can be deployed 24/7 to map and monitor assets, flag problems, and alert the rig's networks and crews of potential risks. the advantages of using the intelligent edge for such operations can be significant. consider how an automated drone could inspect a pipeline for defects. with cloud, the drone might fill its local storage with video of a pipeline inspection, and then return to its base station. it would then upload the video to a remote data center, potentially sending gigabytes of information over the network and requiring significant time to do so. the cloud would apply machine learning (ml) to evaluate the data for defects and, upon spotting them, return that information back to the pipeline site to provoke a response: treat the defect and possibly reroute flows.with edge intelligence, the same ai/ml inference algorithms that the cloud uses to evaluate the video can be run at the edge directly on the drone. instead of scanning and analyzing the entire video, the drone could operate on a small, near real-time buffer of the video feed to classify defects. when it identifies a defect, the drone can immediately notify nearby crews to treat the problem. only frames with defects are archived in the cloud to feed models and training sets, which can then update other drones in the field for better spotting. this minimizes the data load for analysis and transit, greatly reduces the time between inspection and action, and uses the network only for critical information that will add to the toolchain and drive greater insights and learning. who needs the intelligent edge? the intelligent edge can benefit any business that manages infrastructure, networks, clouds, data centers, and connected endpoints such as sensors, actuators, and devices. it can support consumer use cases that require very low latency, such as cloud gaming and augmented and virtual reality. it can enable enterprise uses that require aggregating, securing, and analyzing a great deal of data across operations and customers. and it can improve industrial processes for managing quality, materials, and energy use, such as monitoring factory floors, assembly lines, and logistics. the intelligent edge can benefit any business that manages infrastructure, networks, clouds, data centers, and connected endpoints such as sensors, actuators, and devices.not all businesses will be able to implement intelligent edge solutions broadly right away. many may need to invest in the right infrastructure and partnerships first before seeing a return on investment from narrow use cases. but laying these foundations can give organizations much greater opportunities in the future. 7gaining an intelligent edge: edge computing and intelligence could propel tech and telecom growthwhat's driving demand?in the year ahead, we anticipate that early growth will be led not only by large telecoms but by hyperscale service providers, content delivery network (cdn) providers, and technology companies as they consume and sell intelligent edge solutions. technology companies, while marketing intelligent edge components, appliances, and software layers to early adopters, may also seek to reinforce their own manufacturing and supply chains with intelligent edge capabilities. similarly, telecoms, hyperscalers, and cdns are not only making more capabilities available to their customers, but also expanding their own intelligent edge infrastructures to advance strategic initiatives. in the medium term, the use of intelligent edge beyond these early adopters will likely grow among manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain. most spending on edge computing and intelligence today comes from us telecoms and communication service providers (csps).15 with more devices moving on and off networks, and with more diverse bandwidth needs emerging, these network providers are facing mounting management challenges. they are using intelligent edge technologies to transform and reinforce their own infrastructure, such as by expanding central offices to become next-generation data centers and edge hubs, enabling high-density and dynamic connectivity for 5g and multi-access edge computing (mec),16 and virtualizing more of their networks with solutions such as open ran. these steps support their core business of delivering greater quality of service to subscribers and selling networks to enterprise customers.hyperscale cloud and service providers are also moving quickly to add intelligent edge capabilities to their data-driven businesses. demand is growing from use-case2014driven solutions such as autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics that require low-latency, high-redundancy capabilities, as well as from manufacturing and supply chains seeking greater transparency and resilience in a post2013covid-19 world. further demand may come from the intelligent edge's ability to address emerging regulations for data sovereignty and compliance. with an intelligent edge, data can be secured and held locally, keeping it within the region it was collected instead of sending it to foreign clouds.17 this could potentially draw more investment from social media platforms looking to the intelligent edge to help them comply with regulatory regimes, such as the general data protection regulation (gdpr), that may require personal information to be processed locally and anonymously.18 finally, rising demand from industries like manufacturing and mobility (such as automakers and ride-hailing services) could lead to the development of more packaged and managed offerings. this could make it easier for more businesses to attain intelligent edge capabilities. as the covid-19 crisis accelerates migration to the cloud, businesses undergoing their first wave of cloud transformation could design cloud-to-edge solutions that best meets the needs of their use cases.19who plays in the intelligent edge ecosystem? no single provider seems able to build an effective intelligent edge solution by itself. telecoms, hyperscalers, cdns, and tech companies all play a role in enabling the intelligent edge, with each providing a part of the solution. coordinating these various components is not easy: with each company pursuing its own strategic goals, cooperation is often not far from competition. understanding the role of these players, what they offer, and how they fit in the competitive landscape can better arm organizations looking to attain intelligent edge capabilities. 8technology, media, and telecommunications predictions 2021telecoms and the expanding internetfor many intelligent edge deployments, telecoms are key partners,20 with the largest telecoms increasingly selling their own edge computing and iot solutions as well as on-premise private enterprise networks. as providers within the edge ecosystem, telecoms can offer their enterprise customers and partners end-to-end connectivity for wired and wireless networks, from fiber, cable, 4g/lte, and wi-fi to advanced solutions with 5g and wi-fi 6. they also lease portions of their network that enable direct access to backhaul and offer real estate to host edge appliances and data centers in central offices. cell tower companies can also lease space for edge appliances at their towers, which typically connect directly to fiber.21one key challenge for telecoms is that they no longer have a near-monopoly on connectivity and communication, despite the billions of dollars they spend each year to modernize their networks. many csps deliver network services on top of ip networks, and more hyperscalers and cdns are building their own network infrastructure. however, telecoms2019 ability to provide the combination of backhaul, 5g, wi-fi 6, and the intelligent edge could unleash stronger capabilities for managed connectivity, giving them a competitive advantage in delivering next-generation networks with greater quality of service. hyperscalers encircling the globesome of the world's most valuable companies2014the so-called hyperscalers2014offer end-to-end technology solutions, from cloud services to enterprise productivity and consumer lifestyle experiences. these businesses are highly data-driven, both for optimizing and extending their internal operations, and to deliver better services and drive continued engagement by understanding their customers and users. they are implementing the intelligent edge to advance both efforts by extending their hyperscale capabilities closer to the things they measure, and the enterprises they serve. hyperscalers2019 biggest challenge will likely be to maintain control over data while partnering with connectivity providers. hyperscale networks could indirectly encroach on csps, especially if they were to offer connectivity as a part of their platforms. nevertheless, building high-quality networks is difficult and costly, especially at scale, which makes partnerships with connectivity providers a more feasible route.22as hyperscalers pursue intelligent edge deployments, they will likely establish new proofs of concept and use cases that will further drive adoption across the market. for example, some hyperscalers are positioning voice ai as a key interface modality across all their consumer services.23 being able to run natural language processing on the device2014a smartphone, smart speaker, or car2014without having to go back to the cloud can reduce latency, guard against connectivity failures and security breaches, and deliver greater quality of service while retaining data within regulatory jurisdictions. for businesses deploying intelligent edge capabilities, hyperscalers offer public clouds and the it services and management solutions that run on top of them, as well as ai capabilities. some hyperscalers already control their own cdns as well. their development and marketing of these intelligent edge solutions aim to support their expanding business offerings across cloud, payments, health care, transportation, and media and entertainment.cdns aspiring to become the other hyperscalersarguably, cdns constitute a proto-edge in that they were developed to shift content closer to the consumer to accelerate the early web.24 some cdn providers are now actively pursuing and marketing intelligent edge solutions, putting them in both cooperation and competition with telecoms and hyperscalers.259gaining an intelligent edge: edge computing and intelligence could propel tech and telecom growthcdns have strong relationships with many businesses, and they boast some of the industry's highest-quality, redundancy, security, and delivery capabilities. the intelligent edge may reinforce their delivery networks and enable greater quality of service at a time when more companies need strong delivery services. however, because some hyperscalers and telecoms already control their own cdns, the sectors currently driving the intelligent edge may not need external cdn providers. additionally, cdn companies may not have strong relationships with the industries likely to adopt edge next, such as manufacturing and automotive.tech providers offering hardware and managed servicesunderneath the cloud-to-edge value chain reside innumerable hardware components and software layers that support it. tech providers have a vast growth opportunity in selling their products and services into data centers, networks, on-premise facilities, and endpoints from factory floors and smart buildings to computers and vehicles. data center equipment and wi-fi connectivity will likely be in especially high demand. one forecast expects the edge data center market to approach us$16 billion by 2025.26 tech providers can help telecoms transform their central offices into modern data centers, help manufacturing facilities build stronger on-premise capabilities, and provide intelligent edge appliances and micro data centers to enterprise customers. they can also offer the middleware and management layers that tie these hybrid clouds together into seamless fabrics. in this sense, the edge is another location for the hybrid cloud. also, not all intelligent edge solutions require 5g, and more solutions may develop hybrid networks that include wi-fi, lte, and 5g, depending on the use case. this means that some tech businesses may see more opportunities as wi-fi providers. the latest generation of wi-fi, wi-fi 6, offers bandwidth slicing, better power management, and support for an increased number of devices,27 all of which can enable much more robust and dynamic local networks. private local networks could also help some businesses reduce their dependence on cloud providers and telecoms. all this being said, tech providers2019 position in the intelligent edge marketplace may be challenged by some of their largest customers2014the hyperscalers and telecoms2014building more of their own components, as well as the ongoing trend to dematerialize hardware into software wherever possible. however, as the market matures, tech providers may also serve more second-tier adopters less able to build their own solutions. this shift may be the next milestone for the realization of industry 4.0, in which next-generation cloud-to-edge architectures become more standardized and commoditized.don2019t forget semiconductorsrunning ai on lightweight edge devices can require more specialized compute solutions such as custom field programmable gate arrays (fpgas) and application-specific integrated circuits (asics), as well as gpus designed specifically to accelerate ai algorithms on devices, in edge appliances, and in micro data centers. demand for edge ai chips has grown substantially, and the market will likely expand considerably in the next few years.28 to meet this demand, more semiconductor companies are accelerating production of edge ai chips.29 some are pursuing monumental m&a deals to shore up their position in the next wave of machine intelligence and computation.30 hyperscalers are also designing more of their own specialized chips to support their largest operations. and foundries and chip design firms are responding to meet the demand driven by data centers, ai, and the ever-expanding digitization of industrial systems. 10technology, media, and telecommunications predictions 2021what are the potential headwinds?as it matures, the intelligent edge market faces some challenges. the covid-19 crisis has disrupted demand, challenged supply chains, dragged down earnings, raised costs for many businesses, and injected uncertainty into outlooks. additionally, the ongoing trade war continues to drive supply uncertainty, adding complexity, cost, and time to navigating supplier networks. in this environment, demand is difficult to auger and supply may be unreliable. such conditions may engender a more conservative approach to capex on emerging technologies. businesses may feel they can reinforce their existing cloud capabilities with less risk than implementing an intelligent edge, especially during a crisis that is demanding more remote and connected services.31 building the fundamentals of cloud migration may occupy many businesses in the near term, leaving edge development to the largest companies.additionally, while edge opportunities are becoming clearer, many companies may still regard them as a forward-looking strategic investment rather than an obvious way to drive their current business. implementation can be challenging and costly, often requiring orchestration between multiple providers. standards are still forming, best practices are not yet clear, and security across an abundance of diverse edge endpoints cannot yet be guaranteed.32 in times of greater economic restraint, investments in the future may be easiest for the largest and most durable businesses2014and even they may need to orchestrate services across providers. the year 2021 may thus see the intelligent edge colonized primarily by already-dominant tech sector and telecom leaders, further reinforcing their competitive advantage in the coming wave of transformation. the efforts of these early adopters over the next year can help the intelligent edge prove its value. in the next two years, the market will likely sort out best practices, establish standards and interoperability, and potentially lift early leaders while making it easier for smaller businesses to adopt intelligent edge capabilities.the bottom lineeach party in the intelligent edge ecosystem2014telecoms, hyperscalers, cdns, tech providers, and semiconductor makers2014has a stake in the success of the intelligent edge and the next generation of cloud-to-edge architectures and services. the landscape is young and dynamic, but it also has decades of momentum behind it due to ongoing computing and network trends toward instrumentation, monitoring, and automation of facilities. with digitization, connectivity, and data analysis now maturing rapidly, the intelligent edge is beginning to transform some of the largest physical systems on the planet. like previous large-scale infrastructure upgrades, innumerable unexpected innovations will likely emerge as intelligent edge adoption expands. executives should wade in and develop pilots with a clear path to results and strategic value. they should move beyond buzzwords and terminology to focus on use cases, metrics, and outcomes. most importantly, they should understand that 201cedge201d and

attracting billions of dollars in venture capital.forecasts for the value of the global shared bike market in 2025 range between usd 5 billion and usd 10 billion, and the shared e-scooter market between usd 5 billion and usd 15 billion. the electric bike and scooter device market is predicted to hit usd 24 billion in 2022. covid-19 is expected to boost growth in the medium term as consumers abandon public transportation in favor of more hygienic transport modes.but roland berger sees two major problems with the industry's development:1. it is short-sighted and haphazard. most providers lack mature business models and are too focused on growth, while cities don't tend to reciprocate provider cooperation or use micromobility to cut car numbers. 2. shared micromobility is not

utrecht's bicycle megagarage and barcelona's superblocks. finding the right mix of these use cases is key to building a successful, integrated micromobility system. we identify 7 success factors that represent the key cornerstones of such a system: develop a safe bike lane network; create more parking space for bikes and scooters; better connect micromobility modes with other transport types; offer good suburban micromobility services to promote non-car commuting; prevent or regulate car use in inner city and residential areas; regulate shared micromobility providers to benefit city and

micromobility | 31 / introduction micromobility's macro problemso ne night in september 2017, employees of the us startup bird rides rolled ten stand-up electric scooters from the back of a van onto a sidewalk in santa monica, california. few people had seen or heard of such devices before, so each displayed instructions on how to rent it via an app. with consumer interest piqued, another 250 of the devices followed soon afterwards. after that, nothing could stop bird, legally or metaphorically. eight months and more than 5 million scooter rides later, the company was valued at usd 1 billion, making it the fastest firm to achieve unicorn status. just as bird was launching, china's shared bike craze was reaching its precipitous zenith. some 70 brands, including mobike and ofo, collectively offered more than 16 million bikes in the country in september 2017, and had signed up 130 million users 2013 one in ten of the population. unsurprisingly, the rush didn't last. within a few months, a race to the bottom on prices resulted in the collapse of all but a handful of operators. meanwhile, also in september 2017, the term micromobility was coined by the business analyst horace dediu at a conference in copenhagen. although still fluid, the term is widely understood to describe the use of shared or private bikes and scooters that operate at speeds typically below 25 kmh (15 mph) for journeys of less than 8 kilometers (5 miles). these three simultaneous developments helped put micromobility firmly on the map. since then, the hype surrounding it has only grown. there were more than 150,000 shared e-scooters1 in 177 us and european cities as of march 2020, and around 20 million public-use bicycles around the world, offering convenient, independent and relatively inexpensive urban transport (or sidewalk chaos depending on your viewpoint). dozens of startups have entered the market and venture capital has poured in, with almost usd 4 billion invested in 2018 alone. in 2019, growth was forecast to hit 25% cagr until 2025, suggesting 4 | focusthat shared e-scooters and bikes have the potential to seriously disrupt the transport market. while the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic blunted this trajectory, many experts now believe the virus will only accelerate growth as commuters become less inclined to use public transport for hygiene reasons.bumpy road aheaddespite the hype, our discussions with mobility experts and city authorities lead us to believe there's a problem 2013 the current micromobility system is broken and has no future. why? we see two major concerns. first, the way micromobility is set up today is short-sighted and haphazard. lacking mature business models, many operators have launched by simply throwing bikes and scooters onto the streets. this doesn't help cities, and overlooks shared micromobility's end game, that is, its potential to integrate into a holistic, intermodal transport system where it offers standalone or last mile connections. instead, micromobility is often reduced to shared applications and incrementally added to existing infrastructure. while operators have now started cooperating with cities, the focus is not on issues such as easing traffic congestion. many analysts believe that firms are more focused on growth than purposefully enhancing mobility. as a result, micromobility has really only succeeded in substituting walking and public transport, rather than sustainably removing cars from the streets. cities are still too car-centric and lacking in micromobility infrastructure such as bike lanes or parking spaces. second, shared micromobility is not profitably organized. critical mass is lacking, and low barriers to entry mean competition is fierce. most shared bike schemes are dependent on local government subsidies, 1 in this report, the terms scooter and e-scooter refer only to stand-up electric 201ckick201d scooterswe are convinced that micromobility can not just be saved, but more than meet its potential. taken individually, there are many successful use cases in operation around the world today.for example, and the small number of companies that have come close to profitability, such as us-based lime, have done so only because they rely on low-paid gig economy workers. they must constantly innovate to survive 2013 for example, german e-scooter operator tier has introduced exchangeable batteries to lower costs.but we believe micromobility can not just be saved, but more than meet its potential. taken individually, there are many successful micromobility use cases in operation around the world today. implementing the right mix of these could be the key to turning the hype into success. in this report, we take a close look at the whole micromobility market, from privately owned bikes to shared e-scooters, and provide examples of successful use cases. we conclude by proposing success factors that will form the basis of a well-used, integrated and mutually beneficial micromobility system. only a well-designed micromobility system can catalyze a shift away from cars to more sustainable and space-saving transport modes.mobilizing micromobility | 52 / market analysis cutting through the hypew ith the exception of private bikes and unpowered kick scooters, micromobility devices are relatively recent developments. bike-sharing schemes emerged in the netherlands in the 1970s, and dockless 2013 or free-floating 2013 bikes were first operated by the german rail operator deutsche bahn in 2000. as we have seen, bird's stand-up e-scooters, the first of the type, arrived in 2017, quickly followed by dockless e-bikes. their rise has been rapid. today, there are 150,000 public-use scooters in the us and europe alone, and an estimated 20 million shared bikes around the world. as a snapshot, users made 136 million shared micromobility journeys in the us in 2019, 60% more than in 2018. the majority (63%) were on e-scooters. this sharing revolution took place as the private use of e-bikes soared, with global sales jumping from 1.7 million in 2016 to 2.6 million in 2018. quality, for example of shared bikes and batteries, has also improved.2 big potentialthe latest estimates value the global shared bike market at between usd 2.7 billion (eur 2.3 billion) and usd 4 billion, and the shared e-scooter market at around usd 750 million. the total value of the electric bike and scooter device market was almost usd 19 billion in 2018.3 forecasts for the value of the global shared bike market in 2025 range between usd 5 billion and usd 10 billion, and the majority of sources forecast the global shared e-scooter market at between usd 5 and 15 billion (with one source projecting usd 40 billion). the us and europe are expected

roland bergermicromobility is already eating into the share of journeys made by other forms of transport, and, in particular, has huge potential to replace car journeys. a 2019 report by the mobility research company inrix shows that 48% of car journeys made in the 25 largest us cities are short enough (less than 3 miles) to be replaced by micromobility modes, and the figure is 67% in the uk's five largest cities. before the coronavirus outbreak, this potential was supported by positive public perceptions of micromobility, but the crisis has knocked confidence. roland berger's latest automotive disruption radar survey, conducted in september 2020, shows that a net of 21% of respondents now rely less on micromobility services as a result of the pandemic. more positively, a net of 35% plan to walk or cycle more. bprofits, or total loss?potential and perceptions do not, however, reflect profits. shared micromobility companies are either loss making or produce only small returns, and the coronavirus crisis hit them hard. many, including lyft, lime and bird, underwent major restructuring in the spring of 2020 to address falling user numbers, with hundreds of jobs lost and many markets abandoned. usage has recovered slightly since, with figures from mobility data firm fluctuo showing, for example, that swedish firm voi's scooters in hamburg were used 0.75 times per day on average in may and around 3 times per day in october. similar rises were seen in berlin and oslo, although numbers for competitor tier remained largely flat. consolidation, already a feature of the market before the pandemic, will likely continue. ultimately, shared micromobility is only at the beginning of the technology adoption lifecycle (see box), so now is the right time to think about scale and what future, profitable micromobility systems might look like. cmobilizing micromobility | 7micromobility and the technology adoption lifecyclec: getting theremicromobility modes and their

can be mapped along a technology adoption lifecycle like the one above to give an idea of their penetration. micromobility modes are mapped by their stage of development here.innovators: all micromobility modes have passed this stage. dockless e-bikes and e-scooters were the latest to do so, with devices placed on the streets for users to try out. in the case of shared mobility, innovators were generally niche, tech-savvy groups, like hipsters in the case of e-scooters.early adopters: electrically powered shared mobility modes are currently at this stage, along with docked and dockless bikes in almost all markets. it indicates that modes have been legally recognized and regulated, but use remains occasional and there is no meaningful change in other transport mode shares. early adopters include young city dwellers and tourists.the chasm: private, non-powered scooters, were lost in 201cthe chasm201d as they never became a well-established mode of transport. the big question in micromobility is whether any other modes will fall into it.early majority: private e-bikes and, arguably, shared bikes in the us and a few european cities, along with dockless bikes in china have reached this stage. this suggests hardware has iterated and improved in terms of reliability and safety, becoming more standardized and now accessible to a larger market. growing adoption results in the first significant changes in transport mode behavior.late majority: at this stage, infrastructure and framework conditions are adapted by cities because it is believed that micromobility, especially shared micromobility, can work sustainably. there is real scaling and most of the population are familiar with or already using micromobility modes.laggards: the bicycle reached this stage long ago. it means the market is established and only latecomers are still adopting the micromobility mode.8 | focus3 / use casesshared success storiesf inding the right mix of micromobility-friendly use cases is key to building a successful, integrated urban micromobility system. to get an idea of what a successful mix might look like, we assessed use cases from cities, providers and users around the world that show how micromobility is already improving urban mobility. these were grouped into seven success models, which are outlined below.1. bikes first!what: cities that have prioritized cycling can be categorized into 1) those that developed cycling and pedestrian infrastructure from the bottom up, beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, and 2) those that adapted their largely car-based infrastructure, mostly in the past decade. the first category is smaller and includes mainly dutch cities (for example, amsterdam, groningen, utrecht) as the netherlands has long been a pioneer in bicycle- and person-centered urban design. the second, larger category includes cities such as copenhagen, paris, mexico city, san francisco and singapore. measures in both categories are centered around preventing car journeys while developing cycling infrastructure, such as unobstructed cycle paths, underpasses, traffic-calming measures and intelligent traffic-light systems. why: every measure implemented to improve bicycle infrastructure increases the use of all micromobility solutions.use case a: groningen's mean streetsthe bicycle is the transport mode of choice for about 50% of residents in the dutch city of groningen. this is high even for the netherlands, where the national average is 25%. how has it achieved such a high figure? foresight. in 1977, to make travel safer, healthier and sustainable, the local government decided to promote methodologythe first step involved identifying the framework conditions that most benefit micromobility in cities. the following key areas emerged:2022 mobility strategy/goals and attitude towards micromobility2022 regulation of shared device providers2022 bike lane network expansion plans2022 use of mobility hubs 2022 presence of car-free zones2022 charging of city center access tolls2022 extent of covid-19-related mobility measures and adaptations2022 use of micromobility-promoting business models and technologies by providers2022 level of micromobility-friendly connectivity/digitalization2022 user actions to promote micromobility once the framework conditions were set, we selected a pool of micromobility-friendly cities from which to draw use cases. this was done using the results of the annual copenhagenize index (the leading ranking of bicycle-friendly cities), current transport reports and recent micromobility-related news stories about cities and providers.finally, specific success models and use cases 2013 from both cities and providers 2013 were chosen based on their contribution to making mobility in cities more sustainable, convenient and safe. cycling and walking and make driving in the city center more difficult. it developed a traffic circulation plan that divided the city center into four quadrants. cars were prevented from driving directly between quadrants, instead having to drive out of town and onto a ring road to get to a neighboring quadrant, while bikes were allowed to freely move between them. at the same time, car parking places were reallocated to the outskirts, a park & ride system established and bicycle infrastructure developed.mobilizing micromobility | 9d: from a to dgroningen's quadrant system prevents cars from easily moving through the city center 2013 but bikes are free to roam i n ner cityquadrant 1quadrant 2quadrant 3quadrant 4source: roland bergerthe extra time and distance required to drive in the city quickly made car travel unattractive 2013 by the 1980s, city-center car traffic had fallen by 44%. meanwhile, the bike became the favored mode of transport, and the number of pedestrians and use of public transport increased. city visitor numbers did not drop, however, and city center retail sales even rose. duse case b: copenhagen's quality of life cycledenmark's capital is considered a world leader in cycling, 10 | focuslending its name to the copenhagenize index of bike-friendly cities and consistently topping it. in recent years, it has redesigned its existing car-friendly infrastructure, widening cycle lanes, clearly demarcating them from roads and linking them to form arteries across the city. today, bikes have a commuter modal share of more than 60% (compared to 5-15% in most major european cities) and there are just under 1,000 km of cycle paths in greater and often rainy copenhagen (compared to 125 km 2013 plus plans for another 150 km 2013 in mostly sunny rome, a city with four times the population). in 2018, 14% of new bicycle commuters had switched from cars. yet the transport infrastructure in copenhagen is similar to that found in many european cities. many areas are still very car-friendly, with wide roads, lots of car parking spaces and too few bicycle parking spaces. the differences in cycling infrastructure are mainly qualitative, and even these are not as advanced as in the netherlands. the big difference, however, is that copenhagen has made its bike-friendly changes in a matter of a few years. targeting bike lanes to make them wider and safer for bikes and scooters is particularly beneficial. in germany, for example, a government survey in 2019 found that only 42% of people think that bicycle lanes in their city are wide enough. the copenhagen model shows that by addressing such infrastructure problems, even very car-friendly cities can be converted step by step and relatively quickly into micromobility havens.2. disadvantage carswhat: in the past few years, petrol and diesel cars have been cast as the villain of the city transport piece. more and more cities have banned conventional cars from certain areas or regulated their use. for example, paris, rome, bogota, mexico city and singapore all operate car-free days on specific dates; barcelona, amsterdam, madrid and london have introduced traffic-calmed areas with lower speed limits; and madrid, oslo and london charge tolls to enter the city center.why: reducing car use not only encourages the use of micromobility, it also creates space, reduces emissions and provides socioeconomic benefits.use case c: london's congestion remedyin a bid to ease its traffic problems, improve air quality and give cyclists and pedestrians more space, london introduced a congestion charge in 2003. almost all vehicles (residents, emergency service, etc. are exempt) entering a designated central zone must pay a toll, currently gbp 15 (eur 16.60). the scheme has helped reduce congestion, albeit slowly. in 2002, average traffic speeds in the city were around 12 kmh, according to transport for london (tfl), the city transport authority; in 2019 they were about 16 kmh, according to the inrix 2019 global traffic scorecard. in the meantime, the city also expanded its cycle network, investing in marked cycle lanes.the changes have had a clear impact on traffic volumes and the modal split. between 2002 and 2018, the percentage of trips made by private car fell from 46% to 36%, while the use of public transport increased from 29% to 37%. a further 27% of journeys are now made by walking or cycling, with the distance cycled in london currently growing by 5% a year. studies in the city have found pedestrians and cyclists spend more in bars, restaurants and shops than drivers. in june 2020, the congestion charge was pre-emptively increased by 30% to discourage people from commuting by car during the coronavirus crisis. use case d: barcelona's super-healthy superblocksthe city of barcelona has come up with a plan to create havens of public space by creating what it calls superblocks, or \""superilles\"". ordinary city blocks are grouped into 3x3 superblocks, transforming these areas into pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly zones where vehicles can be used only by residents and delivery drivers at speeds of up to 10 kmh, with normal traffic limited to the perimeter.as well as improving micromobility, the main benefits of superblocks are to health and the environment. if barcelona achieves its aim of creating 503 superblocks covering 200,000 m2, it would lead to a 24% reduction in the city's annual air pollution, according to a study by the public health agency of barcelona (aspb) and mobilizing micromobility | 11e: zoned outbarcelona's superblocks prioritize pedestrians and residents over cars and other vehiclescurrent modelsuperblocks

areaaccess controlbasic traffic networkpedestrian priority zonebcnecological. traffic noise would be reduced from 54db to 51db and life expectancy would increase by an average of 200 days per inhabitant. the shift to bike travel and subsequent improvement in physical health would prevent 667 premature deaths a year. the first superblock opened in 2016 and by january 2020, six more had followed and a further 11 were underway. e3. creating spacewhat: many of the infrastructure and transport changes currently taking place in cities around the world are aimed at creating more space for alternatives to the car, while reducing the public space available to cars. most commonly, car parking spaces are converted into bicycle or scooter parking, or turned into sidewalks or parks for pedestrians. particular attention is focused on parking at places that attract a high volume of people, such as city centers, stations and event locations. many cities are working on such concepts, including oslo, bogota, copenhagen, amsterdam and hamburg.why: more space means more accessible micromobility. bike and scooter riders have more freedom to travel, with the added advantage that there are fewer cars to compete with.use case e: oslo's drive against carsoslo is clamping down hard on cars. the norwegian capital completed a plan to remove around 750 curbside parking places in the city center in 2019, replacing them with clearly marked bike lanes, greenery and benches. it also banned cars from certain streets. at the same time, the city ran a grant scheme to help residents purchase e-bikes, and use of the local bike-share system tripled to nearly 3 million trips a year between 2015 and 2018. it has even trialed the use of bikes with spiked tires to allow year-round use of bike sharing, which is usually halted in winter.the city center is now almost entirely car free. exceptions are made for delivery vehicles during specified hours, as well as for electric vehicles, people with disabilities and emergency vehicles. instead, 9,000 covered car-parking spaces have been opened outside the city center, with drivers diverted away from it. the ultimate aim is to reverse the priority previously given to cars and place it on pedestrians, micromobility users and public transport. the city also wants to create a network of pedestrian zones that are completely free of cars.use case f: utrecht's multistory megagaragedutch cities have become a victim of their own success when it comes to bikes. decades-old bike-promotion schemes have been so successful that finding somewhere to park bikes in city centers has become difficult. but the city of utrecht has found a solution 2013 the bicycle megagarage. the \""stationsstalling\"" building at the main train station is 350 meters long, cost eur 30 million and will have taken five years to complete once it is finished in 2021, but can house 12,500 bikes, making it the biggest bike garage in the world. to help commuters navigate to and from their allocated bay, cycle lanes in the three-story building are color-coded. it also forms an integral part of the city's bike lane system, with one passing through it. the facility is owned and managed by the municipality, which employs 40 staff to run it, and is open 24 hours, seven days a week. users love it, with occupancy rates hitting 100% on busy weekdays and cyclists scoring it eight out of ten in a survey. in total, utrecht, a city of 330,000, has 24 bike parks, ranging from simple racks to garages, with capacity for around 27,000 bikes. for comparison, m00fcnster in germany, a city with a similar-sized population, has just 3,000 bike-parking spaces. 4. intermodal and flexiblewhat: intermodal transport is defined as \""integrated mobilizing micromobility | 13transport with seamless connectivity between different modes of transportation\"". such modes include buses, trains and trams as well as taxis, bikes, shared scooters and walking.why: micromobility has a big part to play in intermodal transport. inner-city mobility hubs enable hassle-free urban journeys that connect mass transit modes, such as public transport, with first/last mile modes such as car sharing, ride hailing and, of course, micromobility. while the micromobility component of current mobility hubs usually consists only of parking lots outside selected stations, this is changing. dresden, for example, is creating a network of 76 mobility hubs at metro stations, with an emphasis on quick transfers between modes. virtual mobility hubs, usually an app or other software platform, take the concept a step further, offering seamless booking and execution of journeys using multiple mobility types via one or more hubs.use case g: berlin's appy travelersthe new jelbi app offered by bvg, the transport operator in berlin, allows seamless booking of journeys that use both the public transport network and shared mobility services. this means users can plan and pay for journeys in one place, rather than paying separate fares and/or individual subscriptions. mobility types accessible via the app include all publicly operated city trains, metro trains, trams, buses and ferries, and a selection of (e-)car-sharing, (e-)bike-sharing, taxi and ride-hailing operators. as of september 2020, jelbi services were available at eight central metro stations, meaning people using the app have to travel via one of these \""jelbi stations\"" to access all the mobility types. they typically offer shared mobility services in convenient, well-marked locations outside the metro station. the bvg plans to roll out more jelbi hubs \""all over berlin\"". f14 | focususe case h: singapore's virtual hubas a compact city-state with little room for cars, singapore embraced the concept of maas, or mobility as a service, early on. it is now one of the most travel-friendly cities in the world, and a testing ground for smart public mobility. one recent development is zipster, a maas virtual mobility hub app launched in september 2019. like jelbi, it facilitates the planning, booking and payment of cross-city journeys that combine public and private mobility services. but unlike jelbi, it offers an open ecosystem that allows users to choose from a variety of services. privately owned services such as micromobility operators are deep-linked, allowing consumers who want to combine a journey on public transport with a private first/last mile option to select their preferred private provider from within the app. it then transfers them to the provider's website to make a direct booking. by doing so, zipster provides a single point of access to all the modes of transport available in singapore. zipster's producer, which is backed by singapore's main rail operator, smrt, and the carmaker toyota, plans to introduce a subscription service giving monthly subscribers a discount on selected services.5. better connectedwhat: offering micromobility services that enable last-mile journeys at central locations, for example, train stations, makes sense. such public transport hubs offer high volume for service providers as many commuters and travelers pass through them. but what about the place where most public transport starts 2013 the city outskirts? suburban areas often lack good micromobility options and parking, as evidenced by the huge car parks at commuter stations on the outskirts of cities like paris and london.why: creating good intermodal options in suburban areas to connect them with transport networks offers real added value, even if volume is not as high.f: all around townthe jelbi virtual mobility hub app lets travelers in berlin plan, book and pay for intermodal journeys with

i: voi's suburban sprawlnot long after the outbreak of coronavirus in europe in march 2020, the swedish shared e-scooter operator voi noticed a new trend in berlin. e-scooter usage in its suburban markets in the city, such as spandau and steglitz, was rising sharply. research revealed that people forced to work from home were using voi scooters to escape their bedroom desks and run errands, go shopping or head to a local restaurant for lunch. based on these findings, combined with the facts that public transport is often patchier in the suburbs and cycling/riding is often safer, voi is expanding its services in berlin's suburbs. steglitz, for example, is now one of its most successful markets in the city, and in august 2020 it announced plans to introduce more services in spandau. the company says its figures show the potential of the e-mobility business in the suburbs is at least as high, probably even higher, than in the city center. spin, a rival mobilizing micromobility |

charged?management summaryin 1911, coincidentally the same year that a baker electric roadster became the first production vehicle to drive 200 miles (albeit slowly) on a single charge, austrian economist joseph schumpeter wrote the world's most thoughtful book on innovation. it describes the two phases of young industries: first a period of product innovation in which competing solutions proliferate, then, after the emergence of an evolutionary winner, a period of process innovation in which the most efficient producers win through. to our minds, this seminal work has not been bettered in the intervening century and it illustrates perfectly the development of today's market for ev charging systems (evcs).through more than five hundred strategy projects related to evs over the past decade, rb has developed a clear view that electric vehicles are going to win. they are going to win, because, in comparison to their ice cousins, they are simpler, better to drive, quieter, easier to automate, overwhelmingly less polluting and, quite soon, cheaper. in winning, the 2020s will see a wave of creative destruction crash over petrol stations, and a more diffuse evcs market emerge channelling gbp 6 billion of annual spend in the uk alone. it is this ev charging network, and not evs themselves, which are the topic of this paper.at this stage, the nature of this future market is far from clear; today's product innovation phase is throwing up all sorts of ev charging solutions and business models. technically, there are wired and wireless solutions, fast and slow, public and private, of various formats. almost as many business models are emerging to support these solutions, fragmented further by the regulatory and demographic characteristics of different countries, and of their various use cases.this paper explores the nature of the future evcs market, how it will segment, why 201clocation201d is a key consideration, and importantly, what

associated future market measured in hundreds of billions, evcs is attracting much attention.the world is learning that, behaviourally, charging evs is not like going to the petrol station. for one thing, it takes longer and so is a parallel, rather than a serial, pursuit. people are developing a habit of charging their vehicles, a little and often, while they are doing something else.there is a broad consensus that the something-else in question will mostly be 201csleeping201d. charging a car at home over night is mostly convenient, and, until governments find a way to recoup their losses in petrol excise, very cheap indeed. the second most popular something-else will very likely be 201cworking201d, as companies across the world currently wire up their employee car parks and fleet depots. after homes and workplaces, however, there is a crowded field of other evcs locations, unified only by the need for a vehicle to be present while its driver does something-else. these include restaurants and hardware stores, bus stops and taxi ranks, car parks and supermarkets, and even potentially 2014 through wireless charging 2014 the road itself. an old-fashioned highway filling station without retail will likely be one of the smallest such segments. all of these locations will balance cost with convenience; today's mature ev markets seem to be teaching us that, unlike the hydrocarbon world of many habitually driving past a petrol station which costs 1% more, evcs customers can be comfortable with price differentials as high as seven times where the use case justifies it. a we have already seen paybacks for some charger locations of less than a year, but also many that will never recover their investment costs; optimising the power rating, real-time pricing, and precise location of these chargers in order to maximise their utilisation, and thus financial returns, will become a new discipline of our times. through work with data analytics partners, this new discipline is becoming a key focus of the roland berger centre for smart mobility.a / alternative pricing in norway for a 30kwh charging session of a vw golf [eur]242024gnigrahc emoh 1 opc gnigrahc

in common with many other strongly emerging city-level markets. the world's city dwellers, pulled by their wealth and openness to modernity, and pushed by fiscal and air quality regulations, have a high propensity to use evcs, often starkly at odds with their access to home charging. it is in cities, with their fractional ownership models, overloaded power distribution networks and parking constraints where many of the most innovative evcs models are being born.b / private and publicly accessible chargers by country, 2019

charger, or even a simple plug, allows the new ev owner to freeload on the existing networks. it is the price of the car, and not infrastructure, which provides the obstacle to ev adoption, and it is the location of the charger which dictates its utilisation rate. a helpful way to envision all of these competing locations is shown courtesy of edf podpoint. this model, building on the work of their founder erik fairbairn, segments locations in the eyes of a typical customer according to how far from their home charger they are, and how long they are planning to stay there. it can be helpful in thinking about the price sensitivity of customers in different use cases, and the type of chargers best suited for these locations. can implicit assumption of this model is that there are often ulterior motives for providers of charging infrastructure in all environments. in the private arena, this could be as simple as wanting to be perceived as a good host or employer, c / charging use case segmentation and price elasticitylongmotorway serviceslow price elasticitydistancemedium priceelasticityrestaurantsupermarketshortshortsource: edf podpoint, roland berger theme parknational trustretail parkworkplacehigh priceelasticitytrain stationdwell timelongroland bergerlocation, location, location66location, location, locationroland bergerd / direct revenues from ev charging is the tip of an icebergincome from chargers in different locations ...or as complex as seeking access to balancing payments through national grid's fast reserve mechanism. public and semi-public environments have even more numerous motivations. the task of weighing these various benefits and allocating them to the location owner, the location operator, and the infrastructure owner is thus part and parcel of the evcs market. however complex these ulterior motives, ev charging revenue is the tip of an iceberg, and the profit pool has much beneath the surface. dwe will now consider five broad types of location: highway charging stations, public car parking places, destinations, workplaces, and the home, starting with the most publicly accessible.highwaysthe highways charging model is the one most akin to petrol stations; long distance drivers, running out of range and far from home, stop with the primary intention of 201cfilling up201d. speed of charging is vital here to speed travellers on their way. and as with petrol, price elasticity is at its lowest.the challenge for first movers in highway charging has been the low utilisation rates achieved. in young markets, ev uptake can be ponderous and often skewed towards the 201cbridging technology201d of phevs, for which range anxiety is solved by petrol, not highway charging. fast chargers can be expensive, perhaps fifty thousand pounds for the hardware alone, with installation and grid reinforcement on top. these capital costs can dominate charger economics, making the energy cost component of running a network relatively low, sometimes as low as 25%.in combination, a pure highway charging infrastructure model is yet to make anyone rich; the outcome is a tiny 2-3% share of the charging market.as in most countries, the uk's highway charging business models have shown mixed success. the two first movers, ecotricity and tesla, have very different business models: ecotricity is an eco-focused energy retailer and has attempted to draw in its eco-minded clientele, for example, by cross selling discounted miles to domestic energy customers. tesla in contrast has been all about selling bevs and curing range anxiety to sell more of them. as such, its charger's branding has been hi-tech and futuristic, and its pricing designed to ... is supported by location-specific 201culterior motives201d beneath the surface7source: roland bergerlocation, location, locationroland bergerdraw in more tesla owners. neither of these first movers have made huge profits from their charging networks, though their host companies have both prospered.more recent entrants to the uk's highway charging market are also in evidence. petrol stations, fighting to maintain long-term relevance (and perhaps fighting to avoid the long-term cost of land remediation on closure), are part of this. in the foremost uk example, bp acquired chargemaster in 2018 and went on to develop the country's largest network in its offering. many smaller networks have also emerged, a dozen of which are presently establishing a unified roaming tariff to project a simpler national coverage.finally, a notable international entrant to the uk is ionity. a joint venture founded by car oems, ionity has proprietary fast charging technology, developed in-house and made available preferentially for selected ev owners (e.g. free to drivers of new porsche taycans). its international network across europe supports a new breed of high-end international drivers, with the apparently high cost of subsidy being manageable because, for example, even porsche taycan owners are still observed to charge at home. like tesla, this network seeks to allay range anxiety in order to sell more cars, but unlike tesla it has a more open architecture; all other users can then access these chargers too, only at a premium price typically more expensive than petrol.highway charging business models have been difficult to date; home and work charging segments have beaten them for market share, and some chargers have rusted from underutilisation before they have even paid back their investment. but mature markets like norway are seeing highway market shares creeping up as bevs become more popular than phevs, and as long distance ev driving (even before covid-induced public transport anxiety) becomes more common. time will tell how high the sector will rise.on-streetdoes a lack of off-street parking facilities preclude one from owning an ev? the short answer: absolutely not. does that mean i won2019t be able to charge my car 201cin the normal way201d? again, the short answer: absolutely not. fortunately, many different stakeholders have already begun addressing this potential conundrum through a variety of different 201con-street201d solutions. first of all, there are the more 201ctraditional201d charging players such as source london, very often tied to a specific, typically urban, locale. they have been described as traditional here as they were some of the first publicly available chargers and the hardware is the most prototypical bollard-style charging station. although initially targeted towards short-term parking usage, the increasing frequency with which they are located in highly residential areas has somewhat changed the use case to one where overnight charging is closer to the norm. a challenge here is that the resultant increase in street furniture and required installation works put a cap on the scalability of this type of charger as the silver bullet for ev owners without off-street parking. in the last few years, a new style of charger has emerged: one that leverages existing street furniture. several providers, including virgin media, are pursuing solutions like this, but one of the first examples to market is ubitricity. their small, discreet chargers are 8location, location, locationroland bergerinstalled onto existing street lamps with ev drivers charging using a proprietary cable that is able to record the amount of energy charged and act as a 201cmeter201d. the power rating of such devices currently sits around 5 kw for a number of charge points, still noticeably slower than the 7 kw home charger installations, but better than that offered by a standard 3-pin plug, and 201cfast enough201d in an environment where cars will typically be left for a long time.it is not only large-scale megacity initiatives that will thrive here: dundee city in scotland has been able to get its residents to successfully utilise 201ccharging hubs201d located at the top of a multi-storey car park. these hubs are partly powered by solar panels and have allowed the city to become the soi-disant 201cmost ev friendly city in the uk201d. with tight control over its assets, the city council has been able to position the city in a way that allows for more e-mobility infrastructure development, saving a commendable 854 tonnes of co2 emissions (equivalent to 5,452,000 miles of driving) along the way.ambitious city mayors, driving air quality ambitions, will likely continue to be the catalyst for the on-street sector. many variants of this will emerge, sometimes straying into public car parks, some of it (e.g. induction charging pads under taxi ranks) prescribing car technology types, and often drawing on infrastructure funds to relieve pressure on the public purse.destinationsa surprise early leader in the battle for charging customers is a brand-new category: 201cdestinations201d. destinations can include a wide range of venues, the primary purpose of which is neither parking nor charging, but at which cars are typically left for half an hour or more. the single most highly utilised ev charging location we have seen evidence for is a fast food outlet near oslo's international airport, where drivers are known to congregate to avoid the high parking costs of the meet-and-greet. like all new categories, particularly those with such strong and varied ulterior motives, there are no clear rules as to what the price or the offer of destination charging should be.the owners of a restaurant or a shop are unlikely to view themselves to be experts in operating electrical infrastructure, but will have a clear focus on the value of an additional customer, particularly where that customer is likely to be a big spender. some british supermarkets are now offering free charging to entice target customers from competitors. we are living through a period in which the value of chargers in these destinations is unclear. while it is undoubtedly true that some speculatively installed chargers will never achieve a meaningful investment return for either the evcs owner or its associated site operator, there will be others which become very valuable highly utilised assets. the contracts offered between the evcs supply chain and the venues themselves reflect this wide range of outcomes, ranging from one-off sale contracts, to 10-year concessions, and with evidence of cashflows in each direction. what is clear is that there is a kind of land grab underway, and that the ultimate owners of locations that become the gas stations of the future stand to make material gains.9location, location, locationroland bergerworkplaces and fleet depotsthe uk's transport statistics reveals that two thirds of the labour force commute to work by car or van; after 201cparked at home201d, the second longest amount of time that ev drivers spend doing 201csomething-else201d is very likely to be in the workplace. as such, the workplace represents a good place, at least from an owner's perspective, to charge their car. from many employers2019 perspectives, there aren2019t a huge number of immediately beneficial reasons as to why you would install workplace chargers for your employees. many employers haven2019t enough car parking space anyway, it will be hard to charge employees for the electricity, and the installation disruption, investment cost and maintenance costs of the equipment itself will also militate against. however, the goodwill that can be obtained from certain employees and the external pressure for large companies to behave more sustainably have already resulted in some modest uptake. and of course, this is also helped by the government's workplace charging scheme, which has supported 6,500 chargers being installed at workplaces in the uk, and to which the strong personal tax incentives for company car drivers from april 2020 will only add. in the uk, enterprise fleets and company cars are likely to be the main drivers for ev and evcs adoption. around 50% of new passenger vehicle sales in the uk are in this category, and just as corporate taxation rules drove the early adoption of phevs back in 2015, the new zero rate bik taxes are likely to drive bev adoption going forward. yet more in the vanguard than company cars, enterprise fleets are already seeing considerable electrification, with depots for fleets as varied as estate agents2019 city cars, parcel deliverers2019 vans and even buses starting to pop up across the country, particularly alongside ulev zones. there is strong evidence that, for residual cost reasons, hire car companies may be amongst the first to abandon the internal combustion engine. depots for such players, for which higher charging power rates mean saved time and money, are already driving technological advances in the sector, and raise the spectre of such depot locations becoming obsolete if their electrical distribution networks are insufficiently strong.post-covid work and travel patterns will remain an area of uncertainty in months to come. what we have seen, however, is increasing interest from all quarters, including from employers2019 landlords, facilities management players, warehousing companies, and even infrastructure players like idnos, all seeking to invest. home chargingsome estimate that 80% of ev charging will occur at home, a seemingly ambitious forecast given government estimates that suggest only two thirds of the uk's domestic building stock has access to off-street parking. upon closer examination however, this figure could be credible: current car ownership statistics show that 75% of privately-owned cars are parked in a garage or other form of off-street parking, and that of the time the average uk car spends parked, 83% of this parking is at home. for those with access to off-street parking, the simple act of plugging in your car is little toil compared to the convenience of 10location, location, locationroland bergerbeing able to start every journey with 201ca full tank201d, especially when home charging is typically so much cheaper. at first glance, the industrial attractiveness of this largest segment may be relatively modest, except to equipment manufacturers and to contractors in the notoriously tough domestic installation market. the pricing potential for this equipment has a glass ceiling, the technology in it being relatively simple with little demand for innovation. however, we believe that to overlook this market would be a mistake. specifically, we believe there is a significant adjacent profit pool accessible through aggregating domestic ev chargers to assist with grid stability via demand side management (dsm). two different technologies may be in play here: in the first (201cv2g201d), engineers imagine that car batteries will feed in to the grid through inverters, and in the second, simpler approach, the charging of cars at home will simply be manipulated to reduce or increase demand. simply shifting the load that ev charging represents (and incentivising ev owners to do so, through ev-specific tariffs) to an off-peak period has the potential to be of great service to the tso, national grid in the case of the uk. the 2020 may bank holiday was a historic weekend in terms of dsm; covid's impact in reducing demand to its lowest level in 20 years coupled with a period of plentiful sun and wind to mean that national grid was reported to spend gbp 50 million simply getting rid of excess electricity. as part of this, certain domestic customers with smart meters were invited to take part in a trial whereby they were paid up to 5p for each kwh that they used between the hours of 2-3pm due to the expected mismatch in electricity supply and demand. many participants, most of whom will already be more engaged with uk co2 emissions/grid management requirements than the average citizen, delayed running their dishwashers/tumble dryers etc. to maximise their electricity usage as much as possible during those hours. whilst the level of engagement in the trial is very encouraging, the novelty of this trial is unlikely to be sustainable at scale in the long run. will the average uk citizen time their washing such that they save a few pence on their electricity bill? much more credible would be a fleet of thousands, even millions of domestic evs, the chargers for which can be turned on and off by the dso. as such, a connected evcs with smart charging capabilities represents a perfect automation of this process, one that requires no more effort than you would already go to just to charge your ev. a country like the uk presently spends over gbp 1 billion/year on grid stability, a number which is growing as intermittent renewables grow, and a large part of which we believe will soon be served by aggregated home ev chargers..11location, location, locationroland berger4/an iceberg lies mostly below the surface: 201cbelow the water line201d business models the above example of grid stability payments, with an evcs customer benefitting in part from a broader energy services offer, illustrates that the 201ctip of the iceberg201d model of charging for charger utilisation may ultimately be no more interesting than evcs adjacencies.the wide range of players presently exploring evcs illustrate this point. manufacturers, facility managers and installers are mobilising to supplement their existing product range. energy retailers and smart meter asset providers are appending evcs offerings to make their offer more attractive or 201csticky201d.in public environments like highway and destination charging, particularly those with chargers frequented by the most affluent socio-economic groups, advertisers are also getting in on the act: digital advertising screens on chargers are a much more compelling proposition than the ads on petrol nozzles, and the revenues attracted through advertising can be a very attractive fillip to the evcs business model, or, as in the case of the us-based volta, even its mainstay.pure finance models in support of this infrastructure, regardless of its location, are another observable trend. where the first chargers have been bought outright by end users or equity players, alternative asset providers are now emerging. charge point operators with the lowest possible cost of capital seeking rent on the basis of utilisation can now be seen in some markets, with infrastructure funds as the likely protagonists. certain semi-public locations (workplaces, multi-occupant dwellings, car parks, destinations) are attracting wider long-term network investment from businesses like the uk's idnos. we are even seeing exploratory forays into debt-financed networks, with some equity players seeking to offer their charger networks as collateral for increased leverage.perhaps the biggest indirect play in the evcs market however comes not from the physics of the chargers, but from the information that their use contains. a player able to understand the entire use case of the ev charging network by consumers both individually and in aggregate will have an asset of value to transport operators, car oems, power utilities, governments, highway agencies, tourism operators, and even restaurateurs. e-mobility service providers (201cemsps201d) are thus emerging that deploy apps to simplify or reduce the cost of ev charging to the consumer, while simultaneously hoovering up a huge data set on the future of transport. most emsps leverage the open charge point protocol embedded in new chargers to provide a cloud-based software solution able to provide b2b back-office/operational services and to point consumers to available public chargers, regardless of their hardware type or charge point operator. the holy grail is to become the natural monopoly app provider for ev drivers across an entire country, and then to use this consumer power to extract (and share) cost advantages from the evcs supply chain, while simultaneously monetising the growing dataset. the early pace for emsps has been set by chargepoint of the us, but there are many notable new entrants, including several interesting uk players; 12location, location, locationroland berger5/zapmap is now extending its offer from public to home charging, and centrica has entered through its acquisition of the israeli software company driivz.all of these 201cbelow the water line201d models can now be observed beneath the evcs 201ciceberg201d, either alone or in combination; they are not mutually exclusive, and are almost always additive.predicting winners: a mug's gamethe only thing we are relatively confident of is that, as the product innovation phase plays out, the winning companies will experiment with multiples of the locations and additive business models described above. as such the winning management teams2019 styles will be flexible and entrepreneurial.you have read this thought-piece this far, and we are not offering you a reliance letter, so it seems only fair to stick our necks out a little: we expect wireless and v2g to be losers. the engineers in our group hope this is wrong, because these are neat technical solutions, but 201cthe perfect can be the enemy of the good201d. one of the great advantages that bevs have over other technological solutions, not least fuel cell vehicles, is that they require minimal centralised decision taking. the marginal cost of addition is low; you can buy one and just plug it in. every vehicle so bought is another vehicle unable to use a wireless induction charging system without a costly upgrade, and with a cathode chemistry better tuned to driving performance than to power grid stability. oems could build higher cycle-life batteries with induction chargers in for additional cost at the factory, but most people don2019t want these functions, preferring a cheaper car that drives better. we thus think that the central decision taking that would be needed to make induction charging or v2g standards win through are an unlikely fit, except in fleet niches.warming to our theme, we also expect oem-specific charging stations to gradually fade away, though calling these losers seems too strong, as they will serve their intended purpose of securing ev market share in the interim.from a finance perspective, in the public charging arena, we see a moral hazard challenge for debt financed assets. an installer of charge points will be minded to take a punt on a new charger, even where the location is unlikely to lead to utilisation rates with workable irrs, and we can see this creating tensions between lenders and operators.but not all investors in evcs will be losers, indeed we think quite the opposite. we expect high-capacity bevs and wired chargers to be the evolutionary winner, with the comfortable co-existence of chargers in all of the locations described. in the subsequent process innovation phase, efficient operators with low cost of capital and cost-efficient manufacture to open-architecture standards such as chademo will win through. finally we would not be surprised if a single winner were to emerge, at least on a national basis, in the potentially very valuable natural-monopoly worlds of emsps and grid stability aggregators.13location, location, locationroland bergerconclusionwe believe that climate change concerns are going to propel the continued transition of personal transport from ice cars to bevs. underpinning this, the market for ev charging systems is going to be huge, and very unlike the petrol stations that preceded it. in the first instance the home will dominate as a charging location, but this will partly evolve towards public chargers, driven by network infrastructure and behavioural demands, already observable in norway. by our analysis, this transition will take place continuously between now and the 2040s, with near double digit cagrs. the best charger locations, those with strong low-cost electrical distribution systems and distractions attractive to ev drivers, will become valuable assets. the sector will continue to evolve, for example as autonomous vehicles dock themselves to public chargers later in this period, but the course is now being set.

Roland Berger - Not Even COVID Can Stop Interest in Autonomous Mobility (Dec-20).pdf,"Roland Bergers bi-annual Automotive Disruption Radar tracks how disruptive forces such as Autonomous Driving are shaping the sector. As a result of the pandemic, disruption scores were the highest ever recorded with several standout trends: Consumer interest in EVs grew as 3.3% of all cars sold are now EVs, compared to 1.9% in 1H 2018. Compared to the year prior, interest in private vehicle ownership rose 7 points to 76%, while interest in robo-taxis also increased 4 points to 56%. RD activity also hit a record high, with AV-related patents as a percentage of all registered driving technology patents reaching 5.4%, compared to 4.2% in 2019.","""autonomous mobility is coming. Not even the coronavirus can stop it. Coronavirus crisis hit the automotive industry hard but also accelerated the shift towards autonomous mobility, the latest edition of the automotive disruption radar has found. all indicators in the twice-yearly report and survey suggest disruption is still coming to the sector, despite the pandemic-induced downturn and changes in mobility habits. The eighth edition of the adr, which tracks 26 indicators in 18 global markets, found that covid-19 stimulated technology players while hitting traditional oems hard. overall, country scores were the highest on record, with smaller countries closing the gap on bigger markets. the Netherlands ranked number one, as it did in adr7, followed by Singapore, leaving former frontrunner china in joint third with south Korea. the survey results also highlighted a growing interest in electric vehicles and soaring ev sales. for example, 50% of all potential car buyers say they are now considering a battery ev 2013 compared with 35% in adr1 (Jan 2017). interest in private vehicle ownership also rose, and r&d activity hit a record high. in this booklet, we take a closer look at these figures and analyze four real-life developments that underscore the shift to autonomous mobility: commercialization of autonomous mobility services; growing competition in the ev market; oems fall behind as new players enter software market; and the rise and rise of tesla. Key report findings the first adr since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic shows that the transformation of the global automotive industry to autonomous mobility continues unabated despite the crisis. this was the case across all five adr dimensions (customer interest, regulation, technology, infra-structure and industry activity) and their 26 indicators. these measures growing up: evolution of adr country scores since the first edition in 2017 overall score as percentage of maximum score from mobility behavior and vehicle sales to co2 regulations, 5g mobile network coverage and research and development. countries are awarded scores according to their performance in each of the 26 indicators. Overall scores among the 18 surveyed nations were the highest since the adr began in 2017, and the top four countries all achieved totals higher than any previous top-ranked country. the average score also jumped, from around 50% of the maximum achievable score in adr7 (January 2020) to 55%. only one country 2013 Canada 2013 performed worse than in adr7 small but mighty the performance of smaller markets was particularly impressive 2013 the Netherlands recorded the highest score ever, while china was the only automotive superpower201d to make the top 5. results from the survey component of the report (which account for a third of the total score) were a key driver here, with customers in countries that have little or no automotive industry much more enthusiastic about new mobility concepts. down with cars: most countries show an increased level of interest in mobility concepts since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic how many people do you know who don’t or did not want to buy a car because they exclusively use other mobility concepts?201dmost enthusiastic countries about the use of mobility concepts charge ahead several specific developments caught the eye. most notable was a big jump in interest in eves, with 50% of potential car buyers now considering an ev, against 40% in adr7 in early 2020. some of the biggest individual jumps came in china (80% vs. 60%), the Netherlands (45% vs. 30%) and Germany (40% vs. 25%). people living in city centers are most keen on eves, with 60% of potential car buyers living in cities considering one. the rise in interest may be attributable to the massive covid-related government stimulus packages currently being rolled out, many of which include generous ev subsidies. leading the charge: south Korea and china have rapidly expanded their electric vehicle charging networks in 2020number of charging locations per 100 km. This shift in buying intention has translated into an increase in ev sales, particularly in northern hemisphere markets. in Sweden, for example, almost a quarter of all vehicles sold are now fully electric or plug-in hybrid models. and compared to the first half of 2018, the number of evs sold as a percentage of the total number of vehicles sold leapt in France (7.8% vs. 1.8%), Germany (7.2% vs. 1.8%) and the UK (6.9% vs. 2.0%). subsidies no doubt again played a part.an electric market: more people are now interested in buying an ev than they were at the start of 2020percentage of potential car buyers are you considering buying a battery electric vehicle as your next car? tesla remains the dominant ev seller, with its models featuring heavily in lists of the top 5 manufacturers by ev sales in each country. its model 3 saloon is particularly prevalent, with sales in the us and china alone in the first half of 2020 reaching almost 90,000. sales by traditional oems are also picking up, with Renault zoe performing well in European markets, for example. Chinese producers, such as byd and gac, are largely confined to the top 5 of the Chinese market. good, private cars better in previous editions, adr8 measured mobility preferences, where covid-19 also made its presence felt. unsurprisingly, the desire to travel by private car has increased since the pandemic, with the importance of having access to a private vehicle rising from 69% to 76% overall. the increase was greatest among young people and city center dwellers. private preferred: access to a private car has grown in importance since the covid-19 pandemic global average and selected demographic groups before the covid crisis started, how important was it for you to have access to a private vehicle? Despite this, autonomous mobility services don’t seem to have suffered at the hands of covid-19 2013 willingness to use autonomous robocars rose to 56% overall from 52% in adr6 (July 2019). results were particularly high in Asia and the middle east. so, respondents seem to want autonomous cars, but they are not giving up private vehicles. Rise of the robocars: enthusiasm for rob taxi services has risen in the past year, particularly in north America global average and by continent would you use a mobility service based on a fully autonomous robocar & development keeps on developingcovid-19 also failed to dent autonomous mobility r&d activities. the number of full-time equivalent employees working in r&d jobs in the sector and listed on LinkedIn increased by 8% to 147,000 between the first and third quarter of 2020. additionally, the number of registered patents related to autonomous vehicles/functions as a percentage of all registered driving technology patents reached an all-time high of 5.4%. it has risen in all eight adr editions. Patent pattern: the number of autonomous driving-related registered patents has grown every year since the adr began autonomous driving-related patents as a share of all driving technology patents the industry is changing: four real-life examples while the adr indicators and survey results suggest that covid-19 has failed to halt the charge of autonomous mobility, it is real-life developments that prove it in practice, as demonstrated in our four examples. Commercialization of autonomous mobility service women fall behind as new players enter software market growing competition in the ev market the rise and rise of commercialization of autonomous mobility services after much trailing and hype, robo taxis are finally here. the alphabet-owned autonomous driving technology firm waymo, oft-mentioned in previous adr editions, has launched a fully driverless service in the us, albeit almost 18 months later than promised. in October 2020, waymo told ars technika, a technology magazine, that its vehicles are initially operating for and against: reasons for adopting or not adopting autonomous mobility have changed considerably in the past three years percentage of survey respondents reasons for yes (multiple answers possible)if the technology for autonomous vehicles is proven to be safe and well established if same or lower cost than taxi/chauffeur services/cabs if same or lower cost than public transportation if I use the service exclusively reasons for no (multiple answers possible)no, because I want to drive myself no, because I don’t trust the technology for autonomous vehicles no, because I want a human driver no, because I am afraid to have lack of control (e.g. to stop or leave the car) a 50-square mile area covering four suburbs in phoenix, Arizona, alongside a fleet of self-driving cars that have a safety driver. a spokesman said that before the pandemic, the company was providing 1,000 to 2,000 weekly rides in total, five to ten percent of which were fully driverless. 201d the firm added that it expects to return to that volume by the end of 2020, and grow from there. it will now be interesting to see if waymo can establish and sustain a viable business model. if it can, the firm will not only be a leader in autonomous driving technology, but also the commercial leader in the sector. oems fall behind as new players enter software market big-name technology players are not only diving into the ev market 2013 they are increasingly entering the poem software market as well. in the biggest recent development, the us chip manufacturer NVidia announced a partnership with Daimler, the manufacturer of Mercedes-Benzes cars, to produce a software architecture for autonomous driving. a key feature of the new platform will be its ability to update battery and driving software via the internet. for example, data for new features or regulations, such as autonomous parking or updated self-driving rules, can be downloaded via mobile networks as they become available and for the entire vehicle lifecycle. previously, Mercedes updates were largely limited to infotainment apps. the architecture is based on NVidia ai-based drive platform. as with similar products, it offers a range of autonomous driving software, including a central computer to control sensors and ai functions, and reference architecture. like Foxconn platform, it is also open source. drive should be available across Daimler range of brands from 2024.daimler has said it aims to develop the most advanced architecture in the automotive industry. however, its new partnership shows that oems are having difficulties building in-house software competencies. this is allowing new players into the space, players that can better differentiate and therefore be more profitable than mere hardware manufacturers. oems will have to take measures to address this risk and defend margins.Growing competition in the ev market the ev market has seen a flurry of activity recently with the entrance of several new players. most notable is that of Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm best known for making apple iPhone. in October 2020, it unveiled its mih open platform, an architecture consisting of ev hardware and software. but it has one major difference to typical closed ev systems, such as those used by tesla. Foxconn will grant open-source access to third party developers and car companies to develop the platform, with the hope of making it the android of evs 201d.powering up: electric vehicle sales have ballooned in most adr countries since 2018, with Sweden way out in frontev/phev/fcev sales as percentage of total vehicle sales sold units [Foxconn hopes this strategy will quickly lead to new functionalities, such as range improvements. it will layer and separate software and hardware so they can be developed independently and costs kept down. the firm will build evs for others rather than produce its own evs, with platforms developed for several models from minis to powerful awds. Foxconn is also partnering with several firms, including catl and ses, to develop solid-state batteries by 2024. as Foxconn already produces autonomous driving technology, the mih open platform development marks the entrance of a major new industry player. it remains to be seen how established oems will react, especially in Asian markets. The rise and rise of tesla investors love tesla, and it seems that currently companies with a comparable business model can profit simply by being a kind of tesla201d. the valuations of ev makers nio, xpeng and li auto, for example, exploded this fall on the back of strong delivery news. other oems are now trying to piggyback on the us firm success by copying its solutions. there are several reasons for this. Tesla is primarily a technology company. it therefore views its business as much more than selling cars, and as such operates in other areas such as co2 emissions trading, data services, recycling, energy and even mining. By building its own ev platform and software it can offer unique services and features. in addition, vertical integration of key differentiating technology, especially around batteries and its e-powertrain, gives tesla a competitive advantage in energy efficiency. the company unique manufacturing approach that focuses heavily on innovation also gives it an edge. for example, it uses die-cast vehicle digital growth: the number of cars bought through online sales channels increased across the board during 2020 parts rather than spray-painting individual components to save time and money. lastly, its lean online-based sales network has been a boon during the pandemic, when dealerships were forced to close or wind down operations. this has made its lack of physical dealers a competitive advantage. as a result, more and more oems are likely to jump on the tesla bandwagon. it clear from the adr indicators and survey that the future of the automotive industry is (still) autonomous mobility. this is worrying for traditionalists, who know that none of the current major oems are technology leaders. it even worse for pessimists, who can see that even premium oems, with their huge r&d budgets, are struggling to organically meet the required future competency levels. the likes of Foxconn moving into oems core business of vehicle manufacturing is a further blow for the automotive establishment. But on the positive side, these are companies well known for their manufacturing excellence and cost effectiveness. so, it will be interesting to see how the major automotive firms defend themselves from this disruptor attack and ensure they are still producing competitive vehicles in the future. to help companies adjust to the new normal in the automotive industry, including post-covid strategies, disruptor threats and maintaining a competitive advantage, roland berger has developed its automotive triple transformation framework. it aims to help senior automotive executives bring order to the complexity and equip their businesses for the challenges of the coming decade. What is the automotive disruption radar? the automotive disruption radar is a biannual analysis of market trends related to disruption in the global automotive industry. its latest findings are based on field research and a survey of 17,000+ car users across 18 markets (Belgium, Canada, china, France, Germany, India, Italy, japan, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, south Korea, Spain, Sweden, 360-degree coverage: the automotive disruption radar is based on the permanent screening of 26 indicators along five dimensions indicator definitions amount of shared vehicles shared vehicles in car. Evs expected development of battery cost information is also drawn from external sources such as leading mobility experts and major industry reports. each nation is scored along 26 indicators, grouped into five dimensions the adr aims to answer key questions such as: which factors are driving change in automotive ecosystems; how do these factors evolve over time; and what can decision makers do to best manage disruption? ultimately, the adr is a go-to decision-making tool for senior executives in the mobility sector. mobility concept preferences  % of people who know at least one person who does not use their own car for mobility1 customer interest autonomous vehicle preferences% of people who would use a fully autonomous robocar if it cost less than owning a vehicle mobility planning  % of people who use an app at least once a week to plan a trip digitalized culture preferences% of people interested in buying a vehicle directly on the internet preferences % of people who are considering buying an ev as their next vehicle mobility behavior% of overall distance traveled by carve/phev sales% of total vehicle sales customer curiosity people’s web search behavior type approval process current level of regulation 2 regulation restrictions for ices restrictions on ice vehicles in cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants co2 legislation co2 emissions target in g/automotive association activities positive actions/press releases [% of total number of actions/releases]autonomous vehicle 2013 computing power current level of computing powers automotive disruption radar """
Slashdata - State of the Developer Nation (Oct-20).pdf,"This 19th bi-annual survey reached +17k developers in 159 countries and explores COVID-19s effects on developers activities, among other aspects. The data suggests that especially those responsible for tool purchasing decisions have increased technical needs for security, performance, and cloud space due to the pandemic. The top 3 drivers when developers adopt cloud technologies are 1) pricing, 2) support/documentation and 3) ease  speed of development.",""" slashdata is the leading analyst company in the developer economy, tracking global software developer trends based on more than 30,000 software developers annually in over 160 countries. our surveys track the changing landscape of mobile, iot, desktop, cloud, web, ar, vr, games, machine learning developers, and data scientists. our mantra: we help the world understand developers -and developers understand the world. developer economics is a global community engaging thousands of developers of all shapes and sizes across the globe, enabling them to benchmark themselves against the developer nation. we are committed to facilitating community contribution and knowledge sharing, and promoting diversity and inclusion in the developer ecosystem. our vision is to empower developers to shape the future developers extra needs due to covid-19: working and performing during a pandemic will leave deep marks behind, both financially and psychologically speaking. in this chapter, we explore covid-19's effects on developers changing needs in relation to their development activities. language communities - an update: programming languages are often the kernels of strong communities and the subject of opinionated debate. in this chapter, we provide updated estimates of the number of active software developers using each of the major programming languages, across the globe and across all kinds of programmers. why do developers adopt or reject cloud technologies? in a world where infrastructure can be provisioned and destroyed at will, and where data and server configurations can be transferred easily between homogeneous systems, cloud providers have to find other areas of differentiation in order to compete. vendor lock-in is much less of an issue for users than it once was, and the rise of the developer as a decision-maker has put even more power into their hands. in this chapter, we look at some of the reasons that developers give for adopting or rejecting different cloud technologies and provide insight into why things are as they are. who is into devops? devops is commonly used as a catch-all term to describe a cultural shift within organizations that enables developers to release software faster and more reliably. however, devops is not a single, coherent sector or technology, which often creates confusion as to who is considered a devops practitioner. in this chapter, we offer a fresh view on who is into devops based on the activities developers are involved in. we also look at the specific roles and software sectors that are most associated with the devops culture. what do developers’ value in open source? based on our research, the use of open-source software (oss) is ubiquitous in the global developer community. in this chapter, we explore what exactly developers’ value in using oss. we also highlight some uncertainties around the future of the open-source movement by presenting trends across geographic regions and software sectors. Emerging technologies: as interest in a technology waxes and wanes, so does its influence. the hot topic of yesterday becomes insignificant in the face of new challenges and opportunities. in our surveys, we have tracked engagement with and adoption of emerging technologies for the past two and a half years. Developers extra needs due to covid-19 four in ten developers report that they need more flexibility in working hours/workload as a consequence of covid-19.  collaboration tools and platforms are the most important technical need for developers.  self-employed developers and developers who work for small companies have fewer extra needs due to covid-19.  the larger the company developers work for, the stronger their need for self-management and collaboration tools, as well as for mental health support.  developers responsible for tooling specifications and for approving budgets and expenses are in the greatest need of increased security, performance, and cloud space. Who is into devops?  the vast majority of professional developers (more than 80%) are involved in devops in one way or another.  continuous integration (ci) and continuous deployment (cd) are two of the most common devops practices, but only one in four developers use both to fully automate their workflow.  programmers are very likely to use ci/cd, but not so much operational practices such as monitoring applications in production environments.  with some exceptions, software sectors with high concentrations of experienced professionals are more likely to embrace the devops model. Programming language communities 2013 an update javascript is the most popular programming language by a wide margin, with 12.4m developers globally using it.  python now counts 9m users, after adding 2.2m net new developers in the past year alone, outranking java at the beginning 2020.  kotlin is one of the fastest growing language communities, having increased more than two-fold in size since the end 2017.what do developers’ value in open source?  developers appreciate collaborating and interacting with the open-source community more than contributing to open-source projects.  western European developers value almost every aspect of open source more than developers in other regions.  south Asian developers highly value contributing to open-source projects, positioning this region to drive the next wave of open-source development. Why do developers adopt or reject cloud technologies?  pricing and support/documentation dominate developers decision-making process when adopting a cloud technology, but pricing is by far the most important reason for rejection.  there are lots of opportunities for vendors to differentiate their orchestration tools in the market - developers are less concerned with price and more with features that help them to develop.  developers aren’t so concerned with feature set or performance - as long as cloud solutions meet minimum requirements.  developers will reject technologies that don’t provide them with a fulfilling development experience. having access to a community and adequate support are important. Emerging technologies emerging technologies such as ar and vr are not fully engaging oss principles.  little change in engagement and adoption rates indicate that devops has reached maturity.  fog/edge computing is gaining traction amongst developers engaged with the topic, but overall engagement is low.  computer vision is on the path to maturity, and with a strong pipeline of developers learning about this topic, adoption will continue to rise.  fatigue is setting in for some advanced technologies, but adoption is rising amongst developers who continue to engage. Working and performing during a pandemic will developers extra needs due to covid-19leave deep marks behind, both financially and psychologically speaking. in this chapter, we explore covid-19's effects on developers changing needs in relation to their development activities. there have been more than 30 million covid-19 cases around the world, with 7.3 million of those still active. the virus is ubiquitous and affects all continents to more or less similar degrees. working and performing during a pandemic is an experience that will undoubtedly leave deep marks behind, both financially and psychologically speaking. in this edition of our state of the developer nation report, we explore covid-19's effects on developers changing needs in relation to their development activities. 73% of developers reported having additional needs due to covid-19. in particular, 34%, or 7.2 million developers, expressed their need for flexible working hours/workload. quarantine and social distancing policies have encouraged many employers to allow their workers to work from home, where possible. a large proportion of workers are now facing the inconvenience of relocating their working space into their home. among such inconveniences is the necessity of taking care of households while keeping up productivity. under these circumstances, flexibility is seen as the key to success, or simply survival. the next most common perceived needs, reported by about one in four developers, are: collaboration tools and platforms (26%), online training resources (25%), and virtual opportunities to support networking and peer-to-peer interaction (23%). among these three, the only technical one, strictly speaking, refers to the need for collaboration tools, such as video conferencing platforms. the other top needs are related to self-improvement and self-management, and to socializing. the supremacy of non-technical needs is striking. all of the technical necessities, except collaboration tools, sit at the bottom of the list, being reported only by about one in ten developers: better performance in terms of computing resources (13%), hardware components (9%), increased security (9%), and additional cloud space (7%). there are two explanations for these patterns. first, developers may have not indicated the need for extra technical support because it had been already fulfilled, i.e., their employers had already provided them with it. it could also be, however, that developers did not perceive technical considerations as being more important than flexibility, networking, and learning. the bigger the company, the more flexibility is needed% of developers, we ran a random forest model and found that the most important factor in influencing developers needs in relation to covid-19 is their company size. compared to those in middle- or large-sized companies, self-employed developers and developers working in small businesses of up to 20 employees report fewer new needs overall. that is especially the case for flexibility in terms of working hours/workload, and for collaboration tools. the most probable explanation is that they would have already implemented a flexible working schedule prior to covid-19. this is likely to apply to contractors as well as to small, dynamic startups. when it comes to keeping collaboration and interaction going, it may just be easier for small groups of people to maintain old habits or find an easy-to-use tool, such as emailing, phoning, or even getting together whilst respecting the required social distancing. the bigger the company, the stronger the need for all of the above, including opportunities for virtual interactions. a large company typically requires a structured system of communication, and usually that system needs to accommodate the various teams' diverse needs; even more so when a company is locked into an its vendor's services. Interestingly, the need for mental health support also linearly increases with company size, probably as a result of those challenges experienced in terms of flexibility and peer-to-peer communication and interaction. another potential reason is that employees in larger organizations, where nobody is indispensable by default, may be experiencing more performance pressure and be more scared of losing their jobs. While developers’ technical needs due to covid-19 do not change significantly with company size, they strongly correlate to the developer’s level of involvement in tool purchasing decisions. those most concerned about increased security, performance, and cloud space are the ones responsible for tool specs and expenses, as well as budget approval, who usually fulfill roles within technical management. On the one hand, with the increasing number of developers working from home, more machines need to be available and connected via vpn and similar technologies. more layers to navigate introduces complexity barriers that affect work efficiency, but also the need for the implementation of extra security controls. furthermore, servers are often overloaded and downtimes happen more frequently, affecting system reliability. if you add to this the fact that budgets are being reduced or even frozen, due to the economic instability the pandemic is causing, the situation is actually precarious. those in charge are inevitably the ones noticing the need for technical support the most.in a relatively short time, the pandemic has generated and consolidated a series of working practices that had been previously known only to a very small proportion of the population. such new practices, based on remote working and virtual collaboration, are likely to persist after covid-19. if one acknowledges this, investing in optimizing support becomes even more valuable. we recommend that, especially large enterprises, consider the delicate balance between self-management and collaboration needs when designing policies and offering support to their employees in the face of the pandemic situation. it can be hard to assess how widely used a programming language is. the indices available from players like tiobe, redmonk, stack overflow's yearly survey, or github's octoverse are great, but offer mostly relative comparisons between languages, providing no sense of the absolute size of each community. they may also be biased geographically, or skewed towards certain fields of software development or open-source developers. Size of programming language communities in q3 2020 active software developers, globally, in millions we present here look at active software developers using each programming language; across the globe and across all kinds of programmers. they are based on two pieces of data. first, our independent estimate of the global number of software developers, which we published for the first time in 2017. we estimate that in mid-2020 there were 21.3m active software developers in the world. second, our large-scale, low-bias surveys which reach tens of thousands of developers every six months. in the surveys, we consistently ask developers about their use of programming languages across ten areas of development, giving us rich and reliable information about who uses each language and in which context. Nearly 5m developers joined the javascript community in the last three years JavaScript is the most popular programming language by a wide margin, with 12.4m developers globally using it. notably, the javascript community has been growing in size consistently for the past three years. between q2 2017 and q3 2020, nearly 5m developers joined the community - by far the highest growth in absolute terms across all languages. even in software sectors where javascript is least popular, like data science or ar/vr, over a fifth of developers use it in their projects. For the second half-year period in a row, python is the most widely adopted language behind javascript. python now counts 9m users, after adding 2.2m net new developers in the past year alone, outranking java at the beginning of 2020. the rise of data science and machine learning (ml) is a clear factor in its popularity. an impressive 77% of ml developers and data scientists currently use python. for perspective, only 22% user, the other language often associated with data science.java, with over 8m active users worldwide, is the cornerstone of the mobile app ecosystem - android - as well as one of the most important general-purpose languages. its adoption may have remained stable in the past six months but, in the overall picture, the java community has gained 1.6m developers since mid-2017, which corresponds to a 24% the group of major, well-established languages is completed with c/c++ (6.3m), php (6.1m) and c# (6m). the fact that c# lost three places in the ranking of language communities during the last three years is mostly explained by its slower growth compared to c/c++ and php. c and c++ remain core languages in iot projects (for both on-device and application-level coding), whereas php is still the second most commonly used language in web applications, after javascript. on the other hand, c# may be sustaining its dominance in the game and ar/vr developer ecosystems, but it seems to be losing its edge in desktop development - possibly due to the emergence of cross-platform tools based on web technologies’# is growing in popularity, but at a slower pace than php and c/c++as we had found in previous editions of this report too, kotlin is one of the fastest growing language communities, having increased more than two-fold in size since the end of 2017, from 1.1m in q4 2017 to 2.3m in q3 2020. this is also very evident from kotlin's ranking, where it moved from 11th to ninth place during that period - a trend that's largely attributed to google's decision to make kotlin its preferred language for android development. Swift surpassed kotlin in popularity this year, after attracting slightly more net new developers in the first half of 2020 (400k vs 300k). since swift became the default language for development across all apple platforms, the adoption of objective c has been decreasing steadily. this phase-out from the apple app ecosystem is also matched by a significant drop in the rank of objective c, from ninth to 12th place. Finally, the more niche languages - go, ruby, rust, and lua - are still much smaller, with up to 1.5m active software developers each. ruby and lua have been around for more than two decades now, but their communities have essentially stopped growing in the last three years. on the contrary, go and rust appear to be actively adding developers, although it is still unclear whether the two languages will climb the programming language ranking in the coming period.

like to remind everyone that, if you'd like to ask a question, please send an email to ask@guidepoint.com. i'd like to introduce you to our advisor today, elliot fishman. elliot, if you'd like to give us a little bit of background information on yourself, and then we can get started. this transcript is property of guidepoint and may not be shared with any third parties. 1 insights library elliot fishman: my name's elliot. i started life as podiatrist and worked in the health sector for four or five years, and then became much more interested in transport planning and did a postgrad qualification in transport planning, a phd specializing in bike share and micro-mobility back in 201120132013. i then did a postdoc in utrecht university in the netherlands, and since then, i've been running my own consultancy where we specialize in providing advice to government on transport policy issues, active mobility planning, and also some innovative policies like road user pricing and electric vehicle policy. richard stroud: please could we discuss the consequences of covid-19 and social distancing on transport, especially public transport and the consequential investment needed in the space? elliot fishman: i think that's a really good question, richard, and it's something that we've been turning our minds to, like a lot of transport planners have over the last couple of weeks in particular. as travel restrictions have begun to ease and more people have been moving about again, we've been looking at what pressure that's imposing on both the public transport system, but also on infection risk as well, and my background first as a health professional and now as a tranpsport planner has put me in an interesting position to take a look at this. i want to just start off by saying that uncertainty is very high in this. who would have thought six months ago that we'd be in the situation that we're in now? so, it's moved pretty quickly. it's very hard to make predictions about the future in this context, but as winston churchill once said, \""never waste a good crisis,\"" so we've been looking at what are the opportunities here from this crisis to create gains in the efficiency and the sustainability of our transport system. i think the big thing that has come out from the analysis that we've done in australian cities, looking at census data from the most recent census, we've found that, on current loadings, this would be very similar to other big cities, so we've been focusing on, sydney and melbourne, which has a population of 5.5 million and 5 million, respectively, so reasonably large cities, and what we've found is that about seven out of eight commuters that formerly got public transit at the peak hour will have to find another option. that might mean using public transport at an off peak time, so staggering their work hours. it might mean using the bicycle. it could mean working from home. we've modeled both what needs to happen on the inside of the carriage and also what needs to happen outside of the carriage in terms of what other modes of transport can help to make up for the shortfall when you need to get seven out of eight former public transit commuters out of that vehicle. usually, public transport vehicles in big cities operate at about 100% capacity at peak times, especially for the rail network. we're modeling that that's going to need to drop to about 16%, so only 16% full for a train or a bus at peak hour, so that's really the big issue. what's going to need to happen is that we're going to need to make sure that we're freeing up the public transport system for those that have no viable alternative, so if you're in a job that you can't do at home, so you're a frontline health worker or you work in a supermarket or in some other retail sector, then you may need to get to work, and if you work in a central city area, you may need to get to work by public transport, and that's especially true if you've got a very long commute. this transcript is property of guidepoint and may not be shared with any third parties. 2 insights library what we really want to try and do, what the transport's challenging, is to make the public transport system available to the people that need it and get the people out that can either do their job from home or use another mode of transport like a bicycle, or travel at off-peak times. the scale of this challenge is unprecedented. we've never had a situation in any city, really, where we've had to get seven out of eight people out of the public transport system at peak hour. richard stroud: doesn't the plan for social distancing put more pressure on the road network as people will want to use their car more often versus the public transportation due to the implications of social distancing? elliot fishman: i think you're quite right, richard. what we've seen at the height of the pandemic, and the height of the restrictions, we saw toll roads in north america and in australasia has dropped by about 40%201360%, so there was a dramatic reduction, especially private vehicles. for freight, the traffic was about the same or slightly up, maybe 3%20136% up, but now what we're starting to see is the traffic is coming back. in sydney and in melbourne 2014 i assume this would be broadly similar to some of the other oecd countries 2014 we're seeing traffic levels at about 85% of what they were before covid-19, so traffic has come back, and i think what that shows is that, because we know there are a lot of people working from home 2014 a lot of big companies have said, \""we're happy for our staff to work from home for the foreseeable future\"" 2014 what it means is that the proportion of people that are traveling to work that are using their car has gone up, and these i suspect 2014 it's too early to say with any certainty 2014 but i suspect a lot of these people are former public transport users that are saying, \""no, it's just too risky. i want to feel more in control of the level of exposure that i have in this, and i'm going to drive to work,\"" so we're seeing a lot of that, and i think that's really the dark side of all this. there's been a lot of talk of the benefits that have come from covid in terms of people changing their mobility patterns for the better and doing a lot more walking and cycling. we've seen lots of cities that have been involved in that. but, there is a dark side that i fear is just emerging, which is people starting to get in their cars that were formerly using public transport. the real problem here with that, of course, is that it threatens to erode a lot of the gains that cities have made over the last 20 or 30 years in increasing the sustainability of the transport system, but also, as our economies are, in some cases, beginning to recover slightly from the most severe period of lockdown, the congestion may place another burden on the efficiency and the productivity of the economy. i suspect that we're going to see a lot of this in the future. i know that in london, also in sydney, we've seen the leaders of governments say, \""try not to get public transport. use the car if you can,\"" and the unfortunate reality of all this is that cars are big, there isn't a lot of space in cities, and big things don't fit in small spaces, and we're going to have two big problems: one is going to be congestion on the roadways, and then, really big parking difficulties, and people simply not able to find a car park. what i suspect will happen is that, after a week or two of people trying to make their commute by car, they'll realize just how bad it is, and they will be looking for an alternative, and that may, in many cases, be electric micro-mobility. this transcript is property of guidepoint and may not be shared with any third parties. 3 insights library richard stroud: and then, how does the ride-hailing development work? because, they've been putting added pressure onto the road network, the ubers or the bolts and those kind of things. will they just continue to grow? elliot fishman: they have experienced some patchy record over the last three months or so where ride-hailing has been down in some markets about 70%201380%. it's being bolstered in some cases by a surge in growth for food delivery and also small parcel delivery as well, especially at the height of the lockdown where people felt scared to leave their home, and there were some areas where ride-hailing were moving small parcels rather than people. a lot of their former transport task, for ride-hailing, was linked to tourism and air travel. about a third of uber () trips in some cities were to or from an airport, especially where that airport doesn't have a good train connection. now, of course, air travel has all but evaporated, and that has meant that the ride-hailing businesses have suffered. my understanding is that there's been large job cuts in companies like uber, directly related to the huge drop in demand, and i think that might take some time to come back. the reason for that is that a lot of the activities that were associated with heavy ride-hailing usage, like going out to a bar, going to a cinema, going out to a nightclub or a restaurant, those things are starting to come back at a small scale, but not really anywhere near the levels that they were before, and so that means that the ride-hailing sector is going to be depressed for quite a few months, quite possibly into next year or even further into 2022. i think, for ride-hailing, there are some question marks about the economic health of ride-hailing, although i have to say that, from my understanding, most of them aren't making a profit, even pre-covid, so they are obviously somewhat protected in the sense that they didn't employ their drivers, and that has meant that they're not paying drivers. of course, they still do have a lot of fixed costs, and even though they've taken massive job cuts over the last month or so, there's still a lot of outgoings that aren't going to be met by the revenue that they were formally getting in terms of the fares that have now evaporated so severely. richard stroud: to that point, bolt announced yesterday that it was raising funds and they were also saying that they're branching out into food delivery and scooters rather than just the core ride-hailing side of things. elliot fishman: yeah, i think we'll see them branching out a lot because 2014 it was travis kalanick, the founder of uber, that once said, once he realized that you can deliver a car to somebody in five minutes, there's all sorts of things that you can deliver to someone in five minutes, and if there's one lesson that we can learn from the last three months with covid, it's that people have really got a huge level of confidence in ordering online and having it delivered to you, so i think there's some diversification that might be a smart thing to do, and also diversify not just in terms of four wheels, but also looking at two-wheeled micro-mobility as well, so we've seen with uber. in april 2018, they purchased jump (), and now jump has recently been purchased by lime (), which is another e-scooter company, so we're seeing a lot of cross-investment and hedging in terms of one firm investing in the other, so i think we'll start this transcript is property of guidepoint and may not be shared with any third parties. 4 insights library to see a lot more of that, because it creates a more diversified revenue stream which potentially protects the company in unprecedented situations like the one that we find ourselves in now. richard stroud: you've analyzed what's been happening in sydney and melbourne. is there a read-across for london and the larger european cities? elliot fishman: i think there is. even though the numbers will look slightly different, i don't think their proportions will look dramatically different. in most big cities like paris and london and new york, when you look at the central downtown, central city area, the commercial heart of the city, about seven or eight of every 10 people, so 70% or 80% of the workers in those areas, arrive by public transport in a pre-covid situation. so, these hearts of economic activity in these big cities are entirely reliant on high-density, high-efficiency public transport, in many cases heavy rail, but also bus rapid transit as well in some cases, and when you take that away and when you need to take seven of eight riders out of that public transport vehicle in order to maintain that safe physical distancing of 2014 in australia, we're using four square meters per person 2014 that just has a huge impact on the ability of that city to operate. so, we're going to see a lot of large employers say to their staff, \""continue to work from home; it's not safe.\"" it's not safe for two reasons: one is the public transport trip, and the other one is the elevator. for those who work in buildings that require elevators, there's been some modeling done on how long it will take to get people into the office if they all arrive at roughly the same time, and in the worst case scenario, people would have to wait two-and-a-half to three hours to get up from the base of their building to the top of their building, if they maintained a safe physical distance in that elevator that can usually carry 20 people; it may only now carry two or three people. so, that does have a huge impact on the way that we move ourselves and the way that our central city areas function. so, i think we're going to see a lot more work from home, especially if there are some second waves and some hotspots in terms of the reemergence of infections, and that, i think, will spark another set of movement restrictions in order to try and bring that infection curve down. richard stroud: how has the covid-19 pandemic and a greater proportion of people working from home affected the investment in transport infrastructure? elliot fishman: i think it's mixed. what we're seeing 2014 and i can't speak for every region of the world, of course 2014 but what we're seeing in the regions that i'm in, in australia 2014 and i don't expect that it would be dramatically different in many other oecd countries 2014 we're seeing a lot more interest in smaller projects, so big investment in large-scale freeway duplications seems to be something that is a little bit more contentious than it was before, because there are concerns that the congestion levels and the population growth levels that they were forecasting 2014 which was central to the viability of that project 2014 has now started to fall away, and people become less confident in those projections, but we're seeing smaller projects that are more geographically dispersed in order to not just solve transport problems, but also for job creation as well, especially as a weak housing sector and construction sector starts to threaten unemployment queues, trying to create a geographically diverse range of jobs that serve to replace jobs that have been lost in this transcript is property of guidepoint and may not be shared with any third parties. 5 insights library the construction sector is being seen as important. but i have to say that the transport infrastructure sector is, in my experience, isn't especially agile. these projects are a long time in the planning phase, a long time in the environmental approvals, a lot of the gearing up with the level of investment in equipment and tunnel boring machines, that sort of stuff, takes a very long time, and i think there's a lot of inertia with projects, so it may well be the case that we end up doing the same projects that we were going to do six months ago, we're still going to continue doing them, just because there's so much inertia built up for those projects. but on the more positive side, we are seeing a lot of really small, pop-up, temporary projects that are coming on board, especially in terms of the pedestrianization of cities using space differently, using road space differently, so road space reallocation, and creating these pop-up temporary bike lanes that use nothing more than traffic management devices, so or things like plastic bollards or water-filled barriers that are being used as a way of, overnight, creating a bicycle network that formerly would have taken many millions of euros in funding and taken many, many years in the planning and construction phase. these are now popping up overnight, which i think is very encouraging. richard stroud: is it purely a factor just dividing up a road and having a bit hived off for cycling? but wouldn't that have implications on the congestion on the other side of the road, for the cars, that they wouldn't get to wherever they're going as quickly as previously? elliot fishman: i think it's very complicated, and there's nothing more divisive in government, especially local government, when talking about the reuse of road space. you're quite right, there's this tension that exists, this competition for space between the way it was formerly used, which is very often used to provide travel to motor vehicles, and the needs of people that might want to cycle. what i can say is that, from an efficiency perspective, a 3.5-meter carriageway, so a one-lane road, over the course of an hour can carry 2,000 people in cars. that's in highway conditions, so traveling at 100 kilometers an hour, so that's two thousand people. if those people are on bikes, you can actually carry 14,000 people per hour on that same carriageway. so, if the challenge is how do we get large numbers of people efficiently into central city areas, all at roughly the same time, in that peak-hour period, then, from an efficiency perspective, cycling is a much better way to use that space to get more people in over a given length of time, but using that argument that i've used often will mean little to traders that don't want to see curbside car parking taken way outside their store, so there's nothing more divisive than parking policy, really, in government planning. but we are in an unprecedented time, and it's during these times that i think we need to put aside some of the ideological issues that can sometimes come about. maybe i can often be quite shrill when talking about this sort of stuff, but i think what we've seen from governments that have successfully been able to deal with covid-19 and bring down that curve before many thousands of people have died is that they have been apt to look at the science and be advised by the science this transcript is property of guidepoint and may not be shared with any third parties. 6 insights library on how to deal with this, and i think we can apply that same concept also to how do we deal effectively with the transport challenges that are coming up as a consequence of covid as well. richard stroud: does the uk government looking to invest 00a3250 million into creating a new safer cycling network, change the mobility and transport outlook, or are they just chasing other governments like a milan or amsterdam? elliot fishman: i think it's a good start. 00a3250 million is a lot of money, and that money goes further if you think about this in terms of light infrastructure, so that's the infrastructure that i was talking about before, the pop-up bike lanes that use light materials, temporary materials that can be laid down overnight. because, one of the things that is often surprising to some people is that the high-quality bike lane, a protected bike lane, one that's got nice stone and is set in concrete, that can cost about 00a33 million a kilometer. that doesn't buy you much. that only buys you about 83 kilometers of high-quality bike lane if you've got 00a3250 million. but, if you start doing that light or temporary infrastructure, which can cost a fiftieth of the more permanent stone, concrete bike lane, then you can get a lot more value for your money. but, it is light. ideally, the best time to do a bike lane was 20 years ago, but the second best time, of course, is now. amsterdam and milan are very different. amsterdam started this process 40 or 50 years ago, and they've now got the most well-connected network of cycling infrastructure anywhere in the world, and up to 60% of trips in amsterdam are completed by bike, whereas milan's a little bit different. milan really only came into this as a consequence of covid, and it doesn't have much background in the way of cycle planning. it has very low numbers of cyclists relative to somewhere like the netherlands. but for london and for the uk more generally, 00a3250 million is a good start, but the most important thing is rolling it out quickly and cheaply. you can do the beautiful stuff later. for now, we're in a pandemic, and the most important thing is that they stretch that available money as far as you can possibly go, and the essential thing from a user perspective is to create separation between motor vehicles and cycles. it doesn't matter what that separation looks like. if it's a plastic bollard or a traffic divider, then that's okay. the most important thing is getting that separation, and making it beautiful can come later. richard stroud: what needs to happen to achieve safer public transport? elliot fishman: in terms of safer public transport, the most important thing there is that we use well-fitting masks for the people that have to use public transport. my understanding is, from talking to medical professionals, is that wearing a mask is a good idea. not so much to protect the wearer of that mask from getting the infection, but in case that person has the infection themselves and is asymptomatic, protecting other users of the public transport system, so that's essential. also, providing sanitizer at entry and exit points of public transport, public information campaigns about the importance of only using public transport at peak times if you have to use it, and awareness-raising tools for what are the alternatives to using public transport at peak hours, so that's things like work from home, traveling outside of the peak, cycling infrastructure, giving people this transcript is property of guidepoint and may not be shared with any third parties. 7 insights library information about where the new cycle lanes are and how they can use them, journey-planning apps where you can type in where you want to go 2014 some of these already exist, of course 2014 typing in where you need to go, and then it maps out the safest route for you to get there by bike. these are the sorts of things that they need to do, and i think the fundamental element to this is government talking to the community about this is important to protect those frontline workers that need to use the public transport system. it means that seven out of eight people need to get off the public transport system at peak hour in order to make that safe for those that need to use it. we also need to ramp up frequencies at off-peak times as well. it's quite typical in most big cities to run at high frequency public transport service at peak times, and then scale it back during the middle of the day. what we're going to need to do is run peak hour services right throughout the day because, if you can run twice as many trains for a given load, you halve the density of people in each carriage, and that can be crucial to fighting this infection as well, so that needs to happen too. richard stroud: and then, what is needed to make cycles and bike transport safer? elliot fishman: for the cycling, the most important thing 2014 it's hard to overstate the importance of this 2014 it's creating protected bike lanes. it's not just as simple as that, but it gets you 70% or 80% of the way there. if you can create long linear paths of protected bike lane 2014 when i talk about that, i mean large roads. don't put bike lanes on side streets where you have to take a very circuitous route to get from one place to another. it's very hard for those routes to be legible and understandable to a group of novice cyclists, so what we want to do as much as possible is use the big, arterial road routes, the larger roads, that have a long distance that they travel so that cyclists can get on there, they know they're on that road, and then they get to where they need to go, in the same sort of way that 2014 that's where motorists like to travel as well. we need to be able to divide that road up, so that there's a little bit of extra space for cyclists. that means we need about two, two and a half meters, width-wise, that's protected, for cyclists in each direction, so one on each side of the road is the most common way of doing it. that's the most important thing. we also need better bike parking as well. bike parking is central because, at the moment, in many big cities, like new york or san francisco or london, it can be difficult to find bicycle parking even before covid. we're going to need to really ramp up the amount of bike parking in central city areas in particular, but we're also going to need to start to think about bike parking from a residential perspective too because, in a city like paris or london or new york, a large proportion of the housing stock has not been built with the storage of the bicycle in mind. for instance, you're not going to want to carry a fairly heavy e-bike up four flights of stairs and store it in your small apartment, so what i think governments are going to need to do 2014 and i think there really is a business opportunity in this as well 2014 is developing bike storage in residential and perhaps also employment districts as well. they can be pods that are transferable. they take up a footprint about the size of a car park, but they can store six to eight bicycles, integrated with things like solar lighting, internet-connected so that you have sensors, so that you know how many bikes are in there at any one time. this transcript is property of guidepoint and may not be shared with any third parties. 8 insights library so, the user can download an app, and if it's a network where there are hundreds of these pods located around the city that are mounted onto what was formerly one car parking bay. users can sign up, and they can use any of the pods within the network, and they can see what pods have an available bike parking spot in them, so you can monitor capacity in that way, and you could potentially also use it to charge the e-bikes as well. if you've got the solar power there, you could, without drilling any holes in the ground, you could charge the e-bikes as well. the reason i'm talking about this is because an e-bike costs around 2014 it depends what sort of branding, what sort of quality the bike is, but around 00a32,000 for a fairly standard e-bike, and a lot of people aren't going to feel uncomfortable about parking one of those bikes out on the street for any lengthy period of time. in order to give people the option to do that, you're going to need to provide 2014 and i'm talking mainly about local governments here 2014 they're going to need to be able to provide the space for the private sector to come in and provide a solution like this. so, it's a fully enclosed bicycle parking pod. once the sides are closed, you can't get in unless you've got the mobile phone app, which obviously has all your details and your credit card, and you tap your phone on a sensor at the front to enable you to gain access to your bike. i think what's really important about this is that, because so many people are now starting to use bikes to do trips that they weren't formally thinking was achievable by bike, they're going to be looking for the e-bike because it allows you to go faster with less effort, and that's especially important as people are trying to get into central city areas for work, because one of the key reasons people don't cycle, apart from the infrastructure question, is that they don't want to get to work sweaty. and so, if you're looking to replace a tube trip or a subway trip by bike, and might be quite a bit further than you'd normally feel comfortable cycling, then an e-bike is going to start looking very appealing. we're already starting to see this, actually. if you look at places like south korea, that have started to open up, the e-scooters are getting used more now than they were before covid. people are taking more trips. we're also starting to see in some north american markets that have just opened in the last couple of days, the trips that are being taken are much longer than the trips that were taken before covid-19. what we're starting to see is that, instead of just the last-mile solution, they are actually being used for a whole trip as a replacement for a trip that was formerly done by public transit. richard stroud: i was going to ask about the last-mile solution. what about the bicycle rental programs, like the one organized in london by serco, the boris bikes, and other startup companies like lime, mobike, in china? surely they're going to benefit from such investments. is there a particular company that you would look at or are particularly interested in? elliot fishman: i don't have any relationships with any of the companies over and above the other ones, but electric bikeshare is something that i think has tremendous appeal, and in the focus groups and the research that i did for my book on bikeshare, one of the things that really emerged as being important for members of the public that i served was e-bikes. e-bikes was something that people said they would be willing to pay more for, and they would select this over and above a regular pedal-powered bikeshare bike. this is borne out as well in revealed preference data as this transcript is property of guidepoint and may not be shared with any third parties. 9 insights library well, where bikeshare systems that had, say, 30% of their bikes were e-bikes and 70% were regular pedal-only bikes, the e-bikeshare bikes were used three to four times as frequently as the non-electric bikes, so there's definitely a revealed preference from customers, that they want the e-bikes, they're prepared to pay more for them, and it also helps from an operational perspective as well, because, especially in a hilly city 2014 so there are some parts of paris i know that were in their bikeshare system that had this terrible problem of people happy to ride downhill, but not very happy to ride uphill, which meant that the rebalancing of the system became very complicated, and e-bikes helped to get around that. but we're in unknown territory, i have to say, so it's important to recognize that a lot of bike share companies run at a loss. it's actually a lot more expensive than a lot of people think to run a high-quality bikeshare service. yes, dockless, non-electric bike sharing is cheaper, but there are some problems with that model as well in terms of theft and vandalism and rebalancing, and also just the general quality of the bike and the rideability of the bike. now, many

general manager's view of technology marketswhat will it take to win in a rapidly changing industry grappling with covid-19?dear colleague:whenever we gather bain & company's technology practice team, we take every opportunity to have clients join us as guests, speakers and ad-visers. no surprise, keeping our customers2019 voices as a steady presence in our partner meetings is highly motivating. over time, however, those cli-ents have remarked that they also benefit. they2019ve encouraged us to find a way to package some of the experience of a bain technology practice meeting. in particular, they2019ve highlighted several unique features they cherished in the discussions, content and relationships:2022 a sharp focus on shareholder value 2022 a ceo's or general manager's view of strategy2014demanding clear articulation of competition, advantage and executable simplicity to get results 2022 an unrelenting focus on operational improvement as a source of advantage2022 a global mindsetso, after a discussion at our partner meeting in january, we committed to create the first in a series of bain global technology reports. our hope is to fill an unmet appetite among our client leadership and further enrich the partnerships we have with clients.then, in february, the world changed. as the pandemic disrupted our cli-ents, we directed all of our attention outward to client-facing support. we were prepared to deprioritize this report. however, amid the uncertainty, our clients were turning to us more than ever for signposts, discussion and decision making. in the end, we kept the report and added a chapter on covid-19 at the beginning. we2019re struck by our clients2019 resilience. yes, the crisis laid bare overlooked and underestimated weaknesses among technology companies. but it also accelerated existing plans and created 2 | technology report 2020 | bain & company, inc.new, unexpected growth as people around the world scrambled to replicate their lives in virtual format with the help of technology. the report is conceived to respond to our clients2019 interest. the first section, value evolution, takes an analytic view of how equity values and profit pools develop. while equity valuations are often short term, their long-term evolution holds important reminders of the rate of flux and direction of tech-nology markets.the second section offers a general manager's view of major competitive battlegrounds in the tech-nology sector. we think of the general manager's view of strategy as that of a p&l owner: consumed with finding the match between market opportunities and the competencies of their organization. this is inherently forward-looking, focused on growth and earnings, and with a sharp view of the available profit pool, competitive advantage and the simplicity required for an organization to take action. our clients find this approach more valuable than unverifiable market forecasts, complex frameworks and broad declarations about equity returns that don2019t always take into account the capacity to win or mobilizing an organization. the third and last section contains examples of leadership innovation that creates advantage through the operations of the enterprise itself. most great organizations ultimately outcompete their foes through disciplined execution, leading to speed and efficiency. execution includes talent, culture, process and infrastructure. here again, we endeavor to take the general manager's view, rooted in the specific strategy, as opposed to boilerplate methodologies and it systems implementations.i have no doubt that 2021 will be another busy and exciting year for the technology industry. ceos and general managers will grapple with the covid-19 disruption while trying to keep their organiza-tions focused on efficiency, growth, innovation and ever-shifting product boundaries. we at bain look forward to continuing the discussion with our friends across the industry's ecosystem.david crawfordleader of bain's global technology practicea general manager's view of technology markets | 3covid-19: the unanticipated catalystthe pandemic is accelerating transformation across the technology industry .by david crawford, anne hoecker and chris johnson4 | technology report 2020 | bain & company, inc.it's safe to say that at the beginning of the year, everyone expected a very different 2020. then covid-19 hit. the virus has devastated families, communities and the global economy. companies in every industry took steps early in the pandemic to protect and support employees, customers and their businesses, while trying to plan for an uncertain future. in the technology sector, the crisis laid bare overlooked and underestimated weaknesses. it also created new, unexpected growth as people around the world scrambled to replicate their lives in virtual format with the help of technology. but most technology companies haven2019t drastically altered their existing plans. one of the clearest examples: the long-term shift from on-premise to cloud computing continues to be a critical priority, according to a cross-section of it decision makers bain & company has surveyed monthly since march (see figure 1). when the crisis hit, companies paused many of their it investments. early in the pandemic, it decision makers said they expected decreased spending on software main-tenance contracts and on-premise it to continue at least through 2021. the expected spending reduc-tions have only grown more pronounced as the pandemic has unfolded. it wasn2019t all belt-tightening. it decision makers said they immediately boosted spending on cloud-based security and software-as-a-service for remote work in the wake of the pandemic. they expect their cloud budgets to continue growing over the next year and beyond. figure 1: it buyers expect the cloud-computing shift to continue despite covid-19how will covid-19 and the economic environment

visibilityidentifies problemsearlierlarger inventoriesward off shortagesat the same time, the pandemic has spurred technology executives to reshape many aspects of their businesses with one critical objective: resilience (see figure 2). retooling the supply chain has become an urgent priority for many leadership teams. they want to make them less brittle, not just cost-effective. covid-19 disruptions have underscored how fragile extremely lean global technology supply chains have become after decades of shortening cycle times, stripping out costs and inventory, and concentrating production in china and a few other countries. technology executives are showing similar levels of commitment to automation wherever possible, but the pandemic has made automation a way of boosting resilience more than lowering costs. companies are accelerating and programmatically scaling up their experiments with robotic process automation, artificial intelligence and other advanced automation tools. as part of this, technology firms are rethinking their traditional reliance on selling products and ser-vices in person at industry conferences. the pandemic has mandated a dramatic shift to virtual sales, and that approach is likely to persist well after the crisis. virtual channels can reduce costs, improve productivity and speed up sales cycles. it turns out they2019re often just as effective for closing deals, if not more so.6 | technology report 2020 | bain & company, inc.the ways employees have adapted are also remarkable in many cases. for months, many have worked productively from home offices. they2019ve kept their employers competitive despite having to navigate an isolated and often hectic home environment, with children, significant others and rela-tives similarly stuck under one roof. as a result, employer subsidies for remote-work tools2014such as additional phone lines, faster internet, in-home daycare and meal delivery2014have quickly become a new front in the war for talent. the ways employees have adapted are also remarkable in many cases. for months, many have worked productively from home offices. they2019ve kept their employers competitive despite having to navigate an isolated and often hectic home environment, with children, significant others and relatives similarly stuck under one roof.the implications for office space and real estate alone are staggering. many technology companies are considering allowing significant portions of their staffs to work from home permanently; reducing their office footprint; and replacing large banks of cubicles with fewer, better-equipped hoteling spaces.technology has always moved fast, but the transformation across the industry has accelerated faster than some in the industry thought possible. like past crises, this one will favor those who boldly adapt and extend new ways of operating.covid-19: the unanticipated catalyst | 7201cthis rate of creative destruction speaks directly to the vibrancy and capacity for innovation of the technology sector.1.value evolutionfast-forward darwin: the speed imperative in techthe pace of industry evolution continues to pick up .by david crawford and matthew crupifor a sobering reminder of the pace of change in technology markets, just look at the turnover at the top. in 1999, the list of the 15 highest-valued technology companies worldwide was populated by mainframe legacy companies such as ibm; enterprise resource planning (erp) darlings such as oracle; and the winners of the pc/workgroup computing phenomenon: microsoft, intel, cisco, dell and hp (see figure 3).a decade later, about half of the list had been replaced. the most notable additions were early winners in search (google), mobile (apple, qualcomm, samsung) and erp consolidation (sap). for the first time, a semiconductor foundry (taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co.) also made the list (see figure 4).by 2019, 40% of the top 15 had turned over again. the newcomers illustrate the importance of social media (facebook) and the growing influence of china (tencent, alibaba). but the decade's most trans-formative trend was the massive global success of cloud technology. it enabled the growth of other newcomers to the list (amazon, netflix, adobe), and stalwarts from 2009 (microsoft, apple, alphabet) rode the wave to massive valuations 10 years later (see figure 5).only four companies remained on the list through the entire 20 years: microsoft, intel, cisco and oracle. figure 3: the 15 most-valuable technology companies were a mix of established

201cdisruption201d has become a clich00e9, here we2019re specifically referring to companies whose annual revenue growth lags their sector's average by 2 percentage points or more for at least three years in a row. only advanced manufacturing and services companies have a higher likelihood of being disrupted than technology companies.and once a technology company falls behind, it can be difficult to repair. the same bain research suggests that a technology company that has been disrupted is 12% less likely to return to sector-average revenue growth or higher than companies in retail and 17% less likely than those in healthcare, for example (see figure 7). even more striking, the data shows that once a technology company trails its sector for three years or more, its chances of turning things around are very low, indeed (see figure 8). why is strong business growth so difficult to maintain in the technology industry? many industry ceos attribute it primarily to the speed at which technology transitions occur.section 1 | fast-forward darwin: the speed imperative in tech | 13figure 7: once disrupted, technology companies can be hard to repairpercentage of companies that

paradigm-shifting product to evolve and take hold can take many years, sometimes decades. however, the transition from feature phones to smartphones, for example, was completed in just seven

was report-edly worth $78 billion just seven years after its 2012 founding. the china-based company rode the runaway successes of tiktok and musical.ly, an app acquired in 2017 and later merged with tiktok. these apps helped usher in an era of videostreaming and social media built on simple tools that allow users to post short, creative videos and riff off of each other's creations. tiktok is now a global phe-nomenon with hundreds of millions of daily users, although it's currently confronted by a controversy over how it handles user data and is under pressure from the trump administration to become part of a us-based company.the pace of these transitions continues to accelerate. after launching in 2004, it took facebook less than four years to reach 50 million users, according to news articles. by 2016, it took instagram stories less than two months to get to 50 million users, buzzfeed news and other media outlets reported. this also speaks to the 201cwinner-takes-most201d effect in the technology industry. due to abundant cloud-computing infrastructure and mobile connectivity worldwide, a technology platform can reach a massive audience at unprecedented rates. and, of course, increasing scale digitally is nearly frictionless. it doesn2019t require the time or costs involved in producing or distributing physical products. ultimately, scale accrues so quickly to the winners that once a transition is missed, it's difficult for other compa-nies to get in the game. as all technology executives know, technology talent is remarkably mobile and often compensated with company stock. when a technology firm falls behind in its sector, employees often dust off their r00e9sum00e9s and begin scouting new jobs at the next fast-rising company.finally, most technology companies find they must rely on mergers and acquisitions to reposition and extend their businesses. but many lose several years mired in a common series of pitfalls before they hone their m&a strategy and skills. these missteps often include assigning core-business veterans to new market domains where they lack necessary expertise; hiring token outsiders who struggle to lead veteran teams; and making tiny acquisitions and overintegrating them to the point that the benefits of the deal are dissipated. the time lost navigating these mistakes often closes the company's window for recovering. technology ceos understand these challenges well, but that doesn2019t make them any less daunting. so, how do leading technology companies create value and2014just as important2014maintain it? the keys are getting the most out of their core businesses and being willing to evolve, even when it's painful in the short term.section 1 | fast-forward darwin: the speed imperative in tech | 15creating value in tech through constant reinventionleading companies find ways to win platform transitions .by david crawford, ravi vijayaraghavan and chris johnson the largest value-creating transformations in technology involve two things: winning a platform battle, and accelerating growth by either repositioning the core business or extending its capabilities into new domains. the highest-valued technology companies are all platform winners that established their successful platforms as a market transition unfolded. there's microsoft with azure and office 365, amazon with e-commerce and amazon web services, google with search and android, facebook with social media, adobe with creative cloud, and so on.the largest value-creating transformations in technology involve two things: winning a platform battle, and accelerating growth by either repositioning the core business or extending its capabilities into new domains. the term 201cplatform201d is often used broadly. here, we use it very specifically to indicate a product or service upon which others build their livelihood2014one that attracts an ecosystem of partners and customers who collectively deliver value. the concept is as old as road widths, but is more prevalent in the technology sector than other industries. now, it's becoming more critical as abundant foundational infrastructure such as cloud computing and mobile communications has enabled global, interconnected platforms to rapidly scale up.the playbook for establishing a successful platform is no secret: mobilize early, offer the best ecosystem economics, win the anchor partners and customers, scale up the business, and extend and deepen cus-tomer engagement. however, the specifics of each platform strategy vary, and the journey is fraught with pitfalls. a platform by nature creates so-called network effects that can result in attractive economics and a winner-takes-most dynamic. as a result, platform battles are usually hotly contested, with intense races to scale.the key to the other half of the value-creation equation depends on where a technology company falls in its life cycle2014disruptor or incumbent. when a company already has a mature platform-based business model, the formula for value creation involves repositioning the core business as the market transition occurs. when a company's platforms are still nascent and growing, the formula for value creation more often involves extending them into new domains.the core repositioning formula is particularly potent if the market has concluded such a repositioning is unlikely. examples include microsoft's and adobe's repositioning around the cloud, and nvidia's repositioning from mobile devices to graphics and the data center, as artificial intelligence growth exploded (see figures 9a, 9b and 9c).section 1 | creating value in tech through constant reinvention | 17$11 billionsaas photoshop, illustrator, acrobatsaas publishingsaas

can pose conflicts for the old by cannibalizing the core business and alienating existing partners or customers. the better today's business is performing, the greater the resistance to change. but waiting until growth slows is often too late.adobe timed the refocus of its core business well. in 2011, the us-based company charged $700 for a copy of its photoshop software, available only on compact discs. ceo shantanu narayen decided to begin switching to a software-as-a-service model in which adobe licensed a bundle of programs starting at $50 per month, delivered through the cloud. adobe was making a big bet that its new creative cloud would make it a stronger company in the long run, even if it took a hit initially.the transition likely gave adobe executives heartburn. from 2011 to 2014, the company's total annual revenue declined slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion, as its boxed software business shrank. but the creative cloud quickly began to deliver on its promise. in 2014, adobe's annualized recurring revenue was $1.6 billion for the segment that includes creative cloud. by 2019, the bet had paid off in a big way. annualized recurring revenue for the creative cloud segment had swelled to $7.3 billion. the company had 89% recurring revenue, and its stock price was trading at more than 50 times its earnings. from 2010 to 2019, adobe's market value jumped from $16 billion to $153 billion. of course, many companies have missed the opportunity to refocus their businesses, and ended up worse off. nokia, for example, was unable to adapt its feature phone business for the smartphone era. section 1 | creating value in tech through constant reinvention | 19in the years following the introduction of the apple iphone, nokia lost billions of dollars in market value and ended up selling its handset unit.technology companies in a high-growth phase face a different set of challenges when trying to extend their capabilities to create new businesses. the trick is to find the sweet spot where the organization's strengths match a promising market opportunity. examples include amazon's extension into cloud- computing services with aws; apple's extension into mobile media devices, smartphones and media content; and alibaba group's extension into payments, cloud computing and digital transformation of businesses. these companies built on their core strengths to reach new customers, deepen their relationships with existing ones, or accomplish both (see figures 10a, 10b and 10c). alibaba group has successfully navigated several business extensions. from the start, the china-based company's main growth engine has been online marketplaces. but five years after the company's 1999 launch, its leaders took advantage of the organization's e-commerce know-how and created an online payments service called alipay. that product was later spun out as ant group, now one of the largest financial-technology firms headquartered in china.as alibaba's popularity grew, it had to build a massive computing infrastructure to handle the millions of transactions on its various e-commerce platforms. company leaders realized they could turn those

"BCG India Has Unique Challenges in Reducing Emissions, Growing Mobility (Nov-20).pdf","India has undertaken several initiatives to meet the UN Paris Agreement targets, but has unique challenges: heavy dependence on internal combustion engine vehicles, growing crude consumption, substantial dependence on a few countries for crude imports, significant carbon-dependent energy mix,and soaring urban pollution. Alternative solutions are needed to sustain Indias growing mobility needs. The current mobility landscape in India is analyzed to identify the most optimal vehiclefuel combination from two major lenses: sustainability (lifecycle emissions for CO2, NOx, SOx, PM10) and affordability. (total cost of ownership for the end consumer).","""End the reign of single- occupancy vehicles for greater urban access by jo00ebl hazan, benjamin fassenot, and ugo deschamps cities with forward-looking mobility systems have two big, primary goals: to expand access for all residents and to end the supremacy of single-occupancy vehicles (sovs). when access is easy, convenient, and equitable, cities gain in wealth and the well-being of residents. and when most travel doesn't mean one person traveling alone in a car, especially a gasoline-powered car, cities are less congested, less polluted, and less likely to perpetuate patterns that deny certain residents and neighborhoods access to jobs and other opportunities. these words variously attributed to either gustavo petro or enrique , both former mayors of bogote are a veritable urban mobility proverb: 201ca developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. it's where the rich use public transport. Imagine the gains in economic opportunity and social integration, healthier air, and travel time saved. but questions remain: is it possible to achieve both economic growth and greater equity? to ensure people's freedom of movement while working together to save the planet? to preserve a city's character and plan for the future? our research explored these choices. The goals are lofty yet vital for the future well-being of cities. as a starting point for improving urban transportation and mobility, we have built the bcg accessibility index to measure mobility performance across cities and to provide a detailed view of the mobility patterns within a city's borders. these insights can help leaders identify the issues unique to their city and implement the solutions most likely to yield greater wealth and health. in this article, we explain the index, the issues, and the initiatives that cities must undertake. A new measure of mobility our objective was to assess the performance of mobility systems by measuring access to opportunities within a city using a location-based approach. our two main guidelines: the measure should be easy to understand, and it should allow a meaningful comparison between cities around the world and among areas within cities, regardless of the mobility modes available. we defined two metrics: 2022 a zone accessibility index. this shows, for a given urban zone or subzone, the percentage of the city's inhabitants and of jobs in the metropolitan area that can be reached within a certain amount of time (for example, 30 or 60 minutes) using a car or public transit at peak travel times. 2022 a city accessibility index. this is the average of the accessibility indexes of all the zones or subzones, weighted by the population of each one. it measures the percentage of the city's inhabitants and of jobs in the metropolitan area that can be reached within a certain amount of time on average per inhabitant. our accessibility index relies on a unique assemblage of public and private data. we used population and job location data from offices of national statistics, and we simulated travel times by leveraging both api's from private sources and general transit feed specification (gtf's) data from various public-transport operators. working with bcg's specialty business gamma, exhibit 1 | accessibility varies widely even among large, developed cities which focuses on advanced analytics and data science, we developed an algorithm that, when applied to the proprietary data-set, allows us to capture the performance of the road infrastructure (for cars but excluding buses) and of the public-transport infrastructure (trains, subways, buses) in an urban area, with a precise mechanism de-signed to track the time it takes to reach other areas and jobs using various means of transport in and around cities. the accessibility index can also be used to measure access to resources like education and health care. Our research reveals that accessibility, even among large, developed western cities, varies widely. for example, on average, some-one in berlin can reach 41% of the city's in-habitants within 60 minutes using public transit, but someone in Miami can access just 7% of that city's inhabitants via the same mode within the same amount of time. (see exhibit 1.)in addition to differences across cities, we observe large differences within cities. for example, in greater Paris, people in areas with the greatest accessibility can reach approximately 60% of others in the metropolitan area in 60 minutes using public transportation, while those in areas with the accessibility index percentage of the city's population reachable within 60 minutes by public transport percentage of the city's population reachable within 30 minutes by car. For cities with available job location data, we can also map access to jobs by public transit and by car. In London, for instance, the accessibility index revealed that the wealthiest people, on average, have access to 45% of jobs in 30 minutes using the fastest mode of transportation, while the poorest people have access to only 34% of those jobs within the same time frame using the fastest mode. this type of analysis can enable public authorities to focus their trans-port development policy on the most underserved populations and areas, and thus help to provide a more egalitarian and therefore a more prosperous framework for the local economy. accessibility = wealth + equality as cities look to redesign their transportation futures, measuring urban mobility performance is a crucial first step in gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges and choices that lie ahead. the next step is to understand the impact of that performance. to do that, planners must recall the 201ctravel time budget,201d established in the 1970s by yacov zahavi, an Israeli engineer who discovered that the amount of time people spend on travel each day is constant over time and across geographies. for generations, city inhabitants have spent a daily average of 1 hour 20 minutes in travel, with distances expanding as the means of transportation grow (with improvements to infrastructure, development of a transit network, and the recent addition of new mobility options like ride hailing and bike and scooter rentals) and with destinations growing in number as accessibility rises. taking into account this fundamental constant, our measures of cities2019 accessibility have brought to light two crucial findings: better transportation system performance increases the wealth of a city, and it reduces inequality within a city. because people travel the same amount of time every day, improving accessibility means that they can travel to new and more destinations every day. as a result, they will have new opportunities for jobs, education, business relationships, health care, shopping, social gatherings, and more which, in turn, will bring greater wealth and well- being to the city and to those who live and work there. (see exhibit 2.) likewise, the less adequate the transit system, the larger the number of missed opportunities and the lower the quality of life.in other words, an improved transportation system creates a unique dynamic that can end the vicious circle that too often leaves poor people stuck in isolated areas, unable to reach the schools and jobs essential to lifting them out of poverty. another consideration is the shift to re-mote learning and working that has occurred during the covid-19 pandemic. this increase in accessibility, brought about not by improved mobility but by digitization, is likely to continue, at least to a degree. but it is not available to everyone. while it may be an option for wealthier students and white-collar workers, poorer students and blue-collar workers will still rely on mobility to bring them to school and to  the accessibility index shows that driving offers better access than public transit in almost every city in our study, as shown in exhibit 1.this situation strengthens  supremacy. and if individuals continue to travel alone in cars, traffic congestion, pollution, and the accessibility gap within urban areas will grow, especially in cities where residential areas are far from industrial and economic clusters. Hope that the digital revolution would solve the accessibility-related challenges Boston consulting group accessible cities tend to be richer and more equal gdp per capita, an international dollar has the same purchasing power over gdp as a us dollar. faced by cities worldwide has waned. market forces and human behavior have made it hard to move away from the traditional car-centric mobility to a new, more sustain-able system. the new ride-sharing services, touted as a breakthrough incentive to renounce car ownership, are building their businesses by maximizing their own assets on the ground and the number of rides that they sell. rather than contributing to better overall urban mobility, their goal is to multiply the miles covered by their participating vehicles, often at the expense of public transit. a recent study from the union of concerned scientists showed that ride-sharing companies such as uber and lyft are responsible for 70% more pollution than the personal-car trips that they dis-place. the upshot: there are more cars on the road than ever. The archetypes of urban mobility transforming the urban mobility paradigm starts with understanding the status quo. each city is different, and each transportation improvement must be adjusted to the local reality. for instance, although car use dominates in every city, its impact does not manifest in every city in the same way. we have divided the 15 cities that we mapped using the accessibility index into three distinct urban mobility 201carchetypes.201d (see exhibit 3.) further research reveals some of the variables that underlie these archetypes, giving us a general idea of what cities are contending with and why. in some cases, we see evidence that cities2019 efforts to control the mobility mix are paying off. it may be too early to say that these approaches are tried and true, but they certainly point the way. here's a deeper look at the three archetypes: 2022 mobility champions. berlin and Madrid stand out because of the outstanding accessibility provided by both their public-transit and their road infrastructure systems. this aligns with policies and initiatives that were recently established in both capital cities. berlin, which already had a dense suburban train and underground network and a strong bicycle culture, Madrid implemented a ban on older cars that could not meet new antipollution standards and restricted access to the city center to drivers with private parking spots and those who register for parking in advance. these measures have reduced congestion while increasing quality of life. 2022 mobility centrists. New York, London, Paris, and Rome rank high in accessibility by public transportation: 25% of the inhabitants of these cities can be reached within 60 minutes. but this masks the relatively poor access possible by car in these cities (due to inadequate road infrastructure), as well as stark inequities across neighbor-hoods. all of these cities have very dense centers where the wealthy live and qualified jobs are located, and there are large discrepancies in accessibility and mobility system performance between the richest and poorest areas. (see the sidebar, 201ca closer look at mobility centrists.201d) 2022 mobility laggards. most large north American metropolitan areas have very low public-transit accessibility, leaving their inhabitants almost completely automobile dependent. typically, the poor performance of the public-trans-port system in these cities provides no credible alternative to supremacy; as a result, these cities face very high levels of congestion and pollution, which spread into the outlying suburban areas. waging war on the single- occupancy car is not an effective way out of this situation. Los angeles, like california at large, has tried this approach, notably by developing an extensive network of high-occupancy- vehicle lanes. experience has shown, though, that hov lanes are underutilized and that the savings in travel time do not create a significant incentive for people to carpool. such isolated measures against sovs do not provide a sufficiently robust framework to over-come car supremacy, just as carpooling alone is not an adequate mode of urban transport but must be complemented by efficient public transit. The empty quadrant at the lower right of exhibit 3 speaks volumes in London, access to good jobs is lower overall relative to other centrists, but the gap between the share of jobs accessible to people in the richest and poorest areas is less extreme (45% versus 34%). although New York, London, and Paris rank high on public-transportation accessibility, they suffer from large inequalities that force people living in the suburbs to commute to work by car. A closer look at mobility centrists on the surface, mobility centrists seem to have a high level of accessibility, but differences across neighborhoods spell discrepancies between the richest and poorest areas. In Paris, for example, we found a wide disparity between the share of qualified jobs (61% versus 21%) that residents in the wealthiest and poorest areas are able to reach within 30 minutes using the fastest mode of transportation.  National institute of statistics and economic studies  impossible for a city to occupy this space, because to do so would require a web of roads occupying a great deal of public space, which would render the city devoid of character and quality of life. and though it might seem paradoxical, studies have shown that building more and bigger roads does not solve congestion problems; ac-cording to the law of induced travel demand, they simply create more space for more cars and ultimately more congestion or another victory for sovs over safer, healthier, more equitable forms of mo-bility.1is it possible for a city to move among quadrants to improve accessibility and change the archetype to which it belongs? yes. ultimately, as part of a city's mobility strategy, a mobility laggard can become a mobility centrist, and a centrist can be-come a champion. how do we get there? the way to end sov supremacy: a new urban- mobility framework to transform the urban-mobility paradigm, cities need to take the lead. they must establish the right regulatory framework to enable innovative mobility solutions that increase access and thereby have positive economic, social, and environmental effects. and they must shape mobility operations, experimenting with new solutions and monitoring mobility behaviors to ensure that private operators and riders are properly incentivized to switch from individual cars to shared and green modes of transportation. in other words, local public authorities should orchestrate the whole mobility ecosystem. consider the situation of the cities that are now classified as mobility laggards. to improve their mobility performance, they must initially focus on strengthening their public-transport systems. bringing a certain level of efficiency and modernity to the infrastructure is a prerequisite, but investing massively in traditional public-transit infra-structure is probably not the most efficient way to tap the full potential of the current public network it's an expensive, lengthy, and inflexible process. building new metro lines or stations entails years of planning, negotiation, and related friction, and does not always lead to an overall increase in accessibility. instead, mobility laggards seeking to up their game and enable commuters to enjoy the full potential of the city's public-trans-port network can make use of new options just as we have seen our mobility champions do. these options are available to all cities, but they hold particular relevance for laggards, whose first priority is to put in place alternatives to sovs. These cities can couple their efforts to emphasize public transport with the use of modes that are less costly and more nimble. for in-stance, they can supplement public transit with micro mobility alternatives, such as free-floating bicycles, and solutions that encourage increased utilization of vehicles on the roads, like car sharing. cities can take different approaches to developing these options. they can work together with private operators to define a target offering, or they can subsidize or facilitate the implementation of alternative modes through regulations and support of pilot initiatives. with micro mobility, on-demand transit, and car sharing in place, any city will likely score high on the accessibility index. but that does not mean people will move away from sovs. cars could still remain the most efficient and convenient means of trans-port. therefore, in order for mobility laggards to become mobility centrists and, ultimately, mobility champions, they will have to take further steps to induce change and end sov supremacy. The challenge is twofold: to increase the cost of traveling alone in a car and to improve the attractiveness of alternative transportation modes. cities can increase the costs associated with sovs. For instance, they can institute dissuasive measures like congestion pricing and limits on the number of taxis and ride-hailing vehicles on the road. but un-less alternative modes of transport are sufficiently attractive offering satisfactory speed and convenience commuters will likely opt to absorb the increased expense of travel by sov. to improve the appeal of alternatives, cities will need to work with other mobility players. it will require a fully integrated mobility-as-a-service transit system that includes a digital platform, access to the latest mobility offerings, incentives, and measurement tools to ensure that all transport services are running at full efficiency. the objective is not to build some kind of single-transport 201ckiller app,201d but to fully integrate and orchestrate all available services, from incentives to travel planning to pricing to ticketing. this will involve increasing integration across the burgeoning modes of mobility and making sure that providers can collect all the data they need to establish policies and travel options that will push commuters toward more environmentally sound travel modes. while it is mainly the responsibility of public authorities to develop such a comprehensive urban mobility framework, private players, too, must understand both the value at stake and the underlying market possibilities. together, public and private operators can unlock tremendous value by creating mobility coalitions that benefit the economy and community at large. in this way, the seemingly undesirable tradeoffs that have hobbled urban accessibility efforts in the past can be productively addressed and economic growth achieved in tandem with greater equity. Freedom of movement can coexist with efforts to save the planet. and a smart urban mobility framework can preserve a city's character and lay the groundwork for the future. This article is the fifth in a series on the future of mobility. In subsequent publications, we will explore other options available to cities and new-mobility operators, drawing on the findings of our research. we welcome the input and participation of cities and private players"""

Ipsos - Mobility Behaviors and Auto Purchase Intentions (Oct-20).pdf,"As a result of coping with a prolonged pandemic, attitudes on personal mobility are changing rapidly. Shared forms of transportation are being largely avoided by customers, as a survey of 22,000 global consumers found that usage of public transportation and ride hailing services were down 78% and 72%, respectively. Consumer emotions show that a return to shared transportation will not be automatic or natural, and nearly 40% of respondents indicated an increased usage of personal vehicles. As a result there is an increased interest for private vehicle ownership, even among young adults aged 18-39. While there are intentions for a future vehicle purchase, financial concerns are leading customers to postpone vehicle purchases.","""ipsosweb-sessionmobility behaviours & automotive purchase
